<p>The patients have needs. They require a medical treatment for their acute or ongoing ailment. But when that remedy is presented, they frequently refuse to comply or adhere. The most logical explanation appears to be a lack of patient engagement. They lack motivation, are illiterate, or are just plain unwilling. After all, someone who was more knowledgeable about the subject gave them explicit instructions on what to do and why. Although the healthcare system makes every effort, patients frequently don't participate. I've seen that this line of reasoning or perhaps even this belief dominates the system. More than ever before, patients are interested in their health.</p>
