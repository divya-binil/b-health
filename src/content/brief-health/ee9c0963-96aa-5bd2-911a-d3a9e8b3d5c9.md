<p>Apr 07, 2021 01:25 AM PDT</p><p><strong>San Francisco, CA, April 7, 2021 –</strong> As virtual care delivery models are projected to increase substantially over the next two decades, Welkin Health, the San Francisco-based digital health platform, today announced the release of its new digital care management platform designed for preventive, chronic and follow-up care.&nbsp;</p><p>Developed for care teams with virtual, in-person and hybrid care models, the Welkin platform securely combines clinical workflows, HIPAA-compliant communications, and the ability to independently design and deploy customized care programs without a developer’s support. The rollout comes at a time when industry experts are projecting that <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/future-of-virtual-health.html">25 percent</a> of outpatient, preventive, and long-term care will be virtual by 2040. 75 percent estimate budget increases of <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/future-of-virtual-health.html">more than 25 percent</a> to facilitate virtual health in the next decade.</p><p>“The pandemic made it clear to all that telehealth is a viable, sustainable model for delivering excellent patient care,” said Michelle Pampin. “But as we plan for a post-pandemic healthcare landscape, providers will need care management technology with the flexibility to drive positive patient outcomes via virtual and in-person care. That’s what we’re delivering today.”</p><p>The new platform brings together a feature set that gives providers control with tools to design programs for their team members, deliver a holistic care program, and subsequently analyze program efficacy. These features include:</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Patient profile</strong></td><td>Patient information is organized and displayed according to care program requirements. It can include demographics, clinical summaries, historical clinical data, patient engagement and communication preferences.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Clinical workflows&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Scoring assessments, clinical notes, trending data, care plans, lab ordering and results, and electronic prescribing</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Therapy types</strong></td><td>Supports individual, group or relationship types</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Communications center</strong></td><td>Native and integrated voice, video, secure email and SMS — plus HIPAA-compliant, in-app chat messaging</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Document management</strong></td><td>Integrated e-signing for HIPAA waivers and consent forms that auto-store within the patient profile</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tasks and notifications</strong></td><td><p>Define your program with tasks and notifications to overcome alert fatigue and drive more actionable behavior.</p><p>Notifications can be triggered to notify care team members during off-hours via email and SMS.</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Automation&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Create rules and conditions which use trigger events to automate communication, task creation, and scheduling follow ups, to increase efficiencies and reduce workload</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Security and compliance</strong></td><td><ul><li>Geographical, role, and attribute based security</li><li>Audit trail and security log</li><li>Organizational security such as MFA and SSO</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Offline mode</strong></td><td>Allows access to patient information while in the field in low bandwidth environments, and synchronizes updates once back online</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>“We wanted to put control into our providers’ hands” said Dima Limonov, Vice President of Engineering at Welkin. “Each practice is different and it’s not a ‘one size fits all’ approach to patient care. With Welkin we have put the necessary tools in place for them to make those choices — so they can truly focus on wellness.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>About Welkin Health</strong></p><p>Welkin Health’s Care Management Platform allows care teams to increase long-term healthy outcomes for at-risk populations. Teams can build care programs, manage care coordination, become more patient-centric, lower operational costs, and reduce burnout.
