<p>Oroi, Europe's top virtual reality platform for seniors, and MyndVR, the award-winning provider of VR-based, digital therapeutic experiences designed for the ageing population, today announced a groundbreaking transatlantic partnership to expand MyndVR's library of cognitive, physical, and occupational therapies. MyndVR also declares the appointment of Robin Viles as Senior Vice President of Clinical Operations, a position that will increase MyndVR's skills in skilled nursing, treatment, and rehabilitation. Oroi Cognitive, now accessible on the MyndVR network, features a variety of exercises and games that simulate activities of daily living (ADLs), a common set of skills taught by qualified therapists. These ADLs include things like getting dressed, organising a room, shopping in a market, and navigating a city.&nbsp;</p>
