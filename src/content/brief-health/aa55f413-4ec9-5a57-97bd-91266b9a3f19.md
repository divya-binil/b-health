<p>EchoNous, the leader in ultra-portable, AI-guided point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) tools and software, today announced an alliance with electronics giant Samsung, makers of the Galaxy line of mobile tablets.
Kosmos, EchoNous’s powerful AI-guided handheld ultrasound tool, will now be able to run on off-the-shelf Galaxy Tab Active Pro tablets; models 12.0 and higher. “Even for the largest medical providers in the world, every dollar saved is one that can be spent saving another life, and this alliance with Samsung makes it possible for our platform to run on a more economical, off-the-shelf tablet,” explained Kevin Goodwin, CEO of EchoNous.</p>
