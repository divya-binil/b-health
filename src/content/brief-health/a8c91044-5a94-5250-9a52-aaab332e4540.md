<p>&nbsp;</p><p>If I had to pick just one of the many advantages to delivering revenue cycle automation in the cloud, the unique, amazing power of automated software updates “over the wire” will be where our customers will truly start feeling a paradigm shift towards a lighter, more responsive and better experience with the tools they use in their professional lives.
CI/CD allows the makers of solutions to push out changes and updates as needed while still maintaining the highest quality possible.
These specialists write programs that &nbsp;test the software all the time.
Every time a developer hits the “commit” button on her new code, that new code gets thoroughly tested against every other software component and routine automatically.
Continuous deployment (the “CD” part of the equation) makes it possible to push out the new code to the cloud environments whenever it is needed.
Continuous deployment processes ensure that new software passes all tests and gates before it is deployed for use.</p>
