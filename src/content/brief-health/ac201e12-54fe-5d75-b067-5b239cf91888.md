<p>Health care professionals can use the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to improve patient care, collaboration, and effectiveness, with the support of advanced AI technology like ChatGPT to enhance information access, goal-setting, communication, collaborative problem-solving, and personal growth. The seven habits of really successful people is Stephen R. Covey's best-selling self-help book. The book presents general guidelines for success in both personal and professional endeavours. This article examines how these ideas might be applied by healthcare personnel to enhance patient care, teamwork, and efficiency. Take initiative. The latest research, technology, and best practises must be actively kept up with by health care practitioners. They can make wise decisions and give patients the greatest care by actively pursuing knowledge. Furthermore, problems can be avoided before they occur by proactively addressing potential issues like infection control or patient safety. Consider the end when starting. Healthcare professionals should constantly have a clear picture of their objectives and desired results.</p>
