<p>Clinicians are asking “Where’s the beef?” about updated health education content.
Most health education solutions require quarterly content updates, which means despite the fast-changing healthcare landscape, information is only updated four times a year.
SMART on FHIR technology means health content and application updates are pushed to your systems and updated automatically in real time.
This takes the pressure off your IT team and ensures clinicians always have the most current health education.
Clearly, healthcare IT teams have a lot on their plates, and smaller projects like education content updates can get pushed to the side when broader, more transformative projects are on the to-do list.
With FHIR, as soon as your education provider updates a piece of content, it’s immediately available to clinicians.
It uses that information and patient data to tailor search results and recommended health education, serving up applicable content more quickly, cutting down on clicking, and giving clinicians more time with patients.
This feature ensures patients don’t receive repetitive health education and helps clinicians know what to share next.
Health education should fit into the current electronic medical records (EMR) workflow, and Healthwise Advise lives within Epic and appears alongside patient charts, allowing clinicians to view patient records and health education at the same time.</p>
