<p>Surgical robots has been revolutionising surgical care in the healthcare sector for almost 20 years. Robotically assisted surgeries have revolutionised operating rooms and patient experiences all over the world by ensuring highly precise operations, minimally invasive methods, and cutting-edge technology. Despite the advances the industry has made recently, widespread use of surgical robotics is still a long way off. Only a small number of surgical procedures may be conducted on robotic platforms, and the majority of operations are still carried out manually. As a result, millions of patients around the world are unable to benefit from the surgical robotics' precision, accuracy, and consistency. By fusing the tech and healthcare sectors, surgical robotics can build a comprehensive ecosystem that will benefit patients and physician empowerment.</p>
