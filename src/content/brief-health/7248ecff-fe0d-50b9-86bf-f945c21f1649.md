<p>Potential applications run the gamut from streamlining clinical trials to optimizing back-end functions for payers and providers, and could be used in practice within a few years.<br><br>The world is on the cusp of a new era of computing with the advent of quantum technology, a highly touted but abstract branch of engineering with the potential to transform the healthcare industry that has yet to be fully leveraged in real-world applications.</p><p>Near-term uses run the gamut from streamlining clinical trials to optimizing back-end functions for payers and providers, and could start being used in practice as early as the next few years.</p><p>"I'm loath to put an exact timeframe —&nbsp;is it a year? Is it two years, three years to get in production? But we're seeing real results today that say this is going to be tractable in the near-term," Christopher Savoie, CEO of quantum software developer Zapata Computing, told Healthcare Dive.​</p>
