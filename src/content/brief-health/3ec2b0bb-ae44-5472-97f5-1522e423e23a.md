<ul><li>Robotics has started boosting surgery in ways not dreamed about not so long ago.</li><li>Brian Miller is chief digital officer at Intuitive, a medical technology company known for its da Vinci robotic-assisted surgical systems.</li><li>With AESOP and its successor, ZEUS, our goal was to help enhance the ability of laparoscopic surgeons, who spent long days standing next to – and over – patients, and had to hold the endoscope and multiple instruments for very long stretches of time.</li><li>Q. What are the benefits of robotics-assisted surgeries?</li><li>We're in the business of making it easier for surgeons to be their very best.</li><li>Surgeon training is one area that we're likely to see enhanced by this kind of data analysis, where we can benchmark performance and come back to customers with very specific insights into how surgeons are working through each procedure.</li></ul>
