    <p>Executive Summary This paper discusses several challenges in designing
    field experiments to better understand how organizational and institutional
    design shapes innovation outcomes and the production of knowledge. We
    proceed to describe the field experimental research program carried out by
    our Crowd Innovation Laboratory at Harvard University to clarify how we have
    attempted to address these research design challenges. This program has
    simultaneously solved important practical innovation problems for partner
    organizations, like NASA and Harvard Medical School (HMS), while
    contributing research advances, particularly in relation to innovation
    contests and tournaments. We conclude by proceeding to highlight the
    opportunity for the scholarly community to develop a “science of innovation”
    that utilized field experiments as means to generate knowledge.<br/><br/><a
