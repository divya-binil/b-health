<p>With new CMS rules, researchers say electronic health records should be more easily configurable with ONC's SAFER Guide recommendations – which in turn should be reviewed and updated by the agency each year.<br><br>A new op-ed published in the Journal of the American Medical Association offers some suggestions for a "shared responsibility" for electronic health record safety.</p><ul><li>EHR developers should self-assess their IT products each year for safety.</li><li>"In addition, EHR developers should make product default settings conform to SAFER recommendations," they write, with the ONC authorized certification body responsible for overseeing each EHR developer also responsible for assessing compliance.</li><li>As Sittig and Singh explain, the new rule will help hospitals more "proactively assess" their EHRs for patient safety and help "minimize EHR-related safety risks and hazards and to increase EHR resilience."</li><li>But so far, "adoption of the SAFER Guides so far has been sporadic and minimal," the authors write.</li></ul>
