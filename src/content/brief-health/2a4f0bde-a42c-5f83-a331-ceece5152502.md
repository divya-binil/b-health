<p>Public health is going through an unparalleled digital transition in the year 2022. The path has already been travelled before Covid-19, but during the first quarter of 2020, telehealth visits rose by 154% in the United States (CDC, 2020).</p><p>Platforms for telemedicine offer the necessary infrastructure for securing high-caliber, private remote medical care. These platforms are now being used by healthcare providers of all stripes worldwide to communicate with their patients more swiftly and effectively. On the other hand, patients can now readily monitor and analyze their health state at all phases and take prompt action. Healthcare providers are currently under enormous pressure to meet increased demands for flexible and accessible medical treatment. That might entail making it possible for physicians and pharma to communicate more easily.</p>
