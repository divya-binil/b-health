<p>In order to improve its end-to-end at-home testing and care experience, Everlywell, a consumer brand of Everly Health that offers practical and economical diagnostic-driven healthcare solutions, released its first iOS mobile app. The app leverages Everly Health's patented SpotwellTM machine vision technology, which verifies the sufficiency of blood samples in real-time using an iPhone camera. According to Julia Cheek, CEO and Founder of Everly Health, "We are at a critical juncture in the healthcare business, and modern, accessible solutions founded in diagnostics are essential for delivering improved health outcomes for all." "SpotwellTM is another Everly Health breakthrough milestone that is redefining diagnostics for millions of people. We can continue to provide test-takers with a clinically supported testing experience wherever they are with the help of the new Everlywell app. SpotwellTM utilises machine vision from Everly Health.</p>
