<p>GPT-4 adoption surges in healthcare, with 16 companies integrating it for diverse applications like health management, coaching, and medical scribe tools. A wide range of opportunities in numerous areas, including healthcare, have arisen as a result of the introduction of GPT-4, an improved big language model. It was only a matter of time until healthcare corporations began incorporating these complex language models into their services, as I foresaw when the hoopla first began a few months ago. When Microsoft teamed up with Nuance, it became the first major tech company to publicly commit to using ChatGPT in practical healthcare applications. This was the first substantial integration. In the brief time that has passed since then, many additional businesses have imbedded GPT-4 into their operations. It is realistic to predict that this pattern will continue, with a sharp rise in the number of healthcare businesses utilising large language models' (LLMs) capabilities.</p>
