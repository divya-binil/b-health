<p>AI will become part of the daily routine of radiologists soon. So rather than getting threatened, we should understand how it changes its future.<br><br><strong>Radiologists who use A.I. will replace those who don’t</strong></p><p>There is a lot of hype and plenty of fear around artificial intelligence and its impact on the future of healthcare. There are many signs pointing toward the fact that <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/artificial-intelligence-will-redesign-healthcare/">A.I. will completely move the world of medicine</a>. As deep learning algorithms and narrow A.I. started to buzz especially around the field of medical imaging, many radiologists went into panic mode.</p>
