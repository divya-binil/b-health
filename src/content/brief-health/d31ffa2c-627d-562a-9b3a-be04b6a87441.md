<p>Drugs and Digital Therapeutics are rival allies that work together to get superior outcomes. But we need to adjust to the cultural shock of healing with apps. Drugs and digital therapies (DTx) work together harmoniously. Even though DTx has special benefits, it functions best when used in conjunction with conventional therapies. They can accomplish great things when working together, like lowering readmission rates and improving the management of chronic illnesses.</p><p>DTx offer an entirely new therapeutic pathway that takes some getting used to: we visit app stores in addition to pharmacies and use our phones alongside or occasionally in instead of taking medications. Due to its real-time, autonomous monitoring capabilities, better adherence to digital barriers, and data security concerns, DTx has both distinct promise and limitations.</p>
