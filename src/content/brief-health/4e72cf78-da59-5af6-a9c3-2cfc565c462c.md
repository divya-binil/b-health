<p>Inseego Corp., a pioneer in 5G edge cloud solutions, in collaboration with CyberReef, maker of the patented MobileWall family of secure mobile networking solutions, today unveiled a new service that enables the deployment of extremely secure mobile access applications that meet and surpass network security compliance standards, such as the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) for education, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for healthcare, and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The reach and performance required for a 5G private wireless backbone to allow extremely secure communications at the edge are provided by Inseego's cloud-managed 5G CPEs. The remedy is run on Inseego's WavemakerTM 5G.</p>
