<p>Computer vision company Gauss teamed up with biotechnology company Cellex to develop a rapid, at-home and point-of-care COVID-19 antigen test.</p><p>While there are other at-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests available, at least two companies are working on rapid antigen tests that can be performed by people at home without involving a laboratory.</p><p>The Gauss and Cellex test has not yet gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. The companies are pushing for FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) some time this fall.</p><p>Sona Nanotech, based in Halifax, Canada,&nbsp;is awaiting FDA approval for its <a href="https://sonanano.com/sona-nanotech-announces-clinical-evaluation-study-results-for-its-covid-19-antigen-test/"><strong>rapid detection COVID-19 antigen test</strong></a>. The test utilizes a nasopharyngeal swab and provides a result in 15 minutes without the use of either laboratory equipment or a reader, according to the company.</p><p>There is a growing consensus among public health officials and business leaders that a widely-accessible rapid antigen testing solution is needed to decrease the public health threat from COVID-19 and mitigate the pandemic’s economic impact until a vaccine is widely available.</p>
