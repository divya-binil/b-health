<p>Smartphones are becoming an indelible part of everyday life and also finding their way into healthcare. A new study explores the challenges and opportunities of their applications in biomedical imaging (Hunt et al. 2021).</p><p>Smartphones, together with wearable devices, possess a wide array of capabilities such as cameras and other optical sensors, touchscreens, networking, computation, 3D sensing, audio and motion. With proper user-centred hardware and software design these can be turned into convenient point-of-care biomedical imaging systems to assist with diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;Aiming to identify the most efficient applications of smartphone capabilities, a group of researchers at Dartmouth College's Thayer School of Engineering (USA) studied the available and emerging smartphone-related technologies and hardware interface components, such as microscopy or dermatology clips. These were evaluated within three application contexts of monitoring, diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;The authors note that while there are many factors that make smartphone utilisation in biomedical imaging look rational, such as scalability or ease-of-use, its justification is not always sufficiently rigorous and “the majority of original research for [smartphone-based imaging] systems is limited to a single phone model and utilises manual, often fragmented image acquisition and analysis pipelines”.</p>
