<p>Results from Kyruus' sixth annual study of 1,000 healthcare consumers, which looks at preferences for discovering, choosing, and accessing treatment, were revealed today. According to the conclusions of the 2022 Patient Access Journey Report, patients are consumers first. New data has revealed sophisticated purchasing habits, such as using numerous online resources to obtain care and analysing cost, quality, and convenience data before choosing a provider. The study demonstrates how the idea of a "digital front door" is expanding to encompass a number of access points, including websites for healthcare organisations, mobile apps, and Google. Customers continue to rely on digital channels to learn about new healthcare providers when looking for care; 61% of consumers conduct online research, and over 80% of those said they consulted two or more sources.</p>
