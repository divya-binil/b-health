<p>Online insurance marketplace GoHealth CEO Vijay Kotte&nbsp;said&nbsp;the company is "significantly reducing" the size of its agent workforce and support teams in an Aug. 9 letter to employees.&nbsp;The letter did not specify how many employees would be affected, but&nbsp;<i>The Chicago Tribune</i>&nbsp;reported&nbsp;Aug. 11 that 800 people were being laid off.&nbsp;Those affected were to be informed by the end of the day Aug. 9.&nbsp;</p><p>"Please know that this decision was not made lightly," Mr. Kotte said in the letter. "It was only after an exhaustive analysis of our business needs and extensive consideration that we agreed this was the path forward to secure our long-term future and enable GoHealth to achieve its full potential." Mr. Kotte said the Chicago-based company will "emerge from this change as a leaner organization that reflects the highest standards for enrollment and member retention within our agent workforce and marketing investments."&nbsp;Affected employees will receive a minimum of 60 days compensation and benefits, with potentially more severance pay based on position and tenure, according to the letter.</p>
