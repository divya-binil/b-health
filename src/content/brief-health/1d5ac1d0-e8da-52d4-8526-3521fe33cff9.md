<p>The project will initially cover about 60,000 patients in remote locations.<br><br>According to a news report, the pilot digital health programme is a scalable "plug and play" model to provide healthcare to disadvantaged women and children in rural areas.
Quoting Amit Rastogi, a professor at BHU and the telehealth project's local convener in Varanasi, the news report noted that around 65% of India's population live in rural villages where better access to healthcare is "needed".</p>
