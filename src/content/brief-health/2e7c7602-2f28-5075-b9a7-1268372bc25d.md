title: Half of doctors would take a pay cut for less hours, more work-life balance
---

Half of physicians said they would take a salary reduction of up to $20,000 per year in exchange for working less hours and achieving a better work-life balance, according to a new survey.

The Medscape survey of more than 15,000 physicians found that was pretty consistent across generations. Millennials (52%), Generation Xers (48%) and baby boomers (49%) all said they would take a salary cut in exchange for more personal time. That was true even among millennials, who typically earn less than their more established peers. Some 53% of women said they would take a pay cut, versus 47% of men.
