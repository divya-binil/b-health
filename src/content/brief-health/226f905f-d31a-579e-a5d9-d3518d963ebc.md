<p>Ascom offers a unified communications platform that bridges information gaps across points of care. The key to increasing worker efficiency and improving patient outcomes amid severe personnel shortages in healthcare is streamlining on-site communications and resolving information gaps at the point of service. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has put tremendous strain on the healthcare system, personnel shortages are a systemic rather than a temporary problem. The turnover rate among nurses is substantially higher than that of other industries, which exacerbates the shortage. Burnout is a significant element in the low retention of nurses, a problem that has gotten worse as the pandemic has progressed. At the same time, demand for acute care services is currently increasing year over year. The circumstance poses a serious threat to the care standards.&nbsp;</p>
