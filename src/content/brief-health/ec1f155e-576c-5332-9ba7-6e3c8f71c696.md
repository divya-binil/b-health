<p>JAMA Health Forum published a cross-sectional study suggesting reimplementing that licensure restrictions on out-of-state telemedicine, which were lifted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, would have the most significant effect on patients living near a state border, those in rural locations, and those receiving primary care or mental health treatment.
"Relaxation of state restrictions would likely offer immediate convenience to patients who live near a state border and those receiving primary care and mental health treatment," the study's authors wrote. Patients living in a county close to a state border accounted for 57.2% of all out-of-state telemedicine visits, and 64.3% of those out-of-state visits were with a primary care or mental health clinician.</p>
