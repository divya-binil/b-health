<p>The solution provides real-time care coordination between crisis management stakeholders to help individuals access expedited behavioral health crisis assessment and treatment.
Bamboo Health™, a healthcare technology solutions company focused on fostering care collaboration and providing actionable insights across the entire continuum of care, announces the availability of its Crisis Management System in support of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.
Among current Crisis Management System deployments, one state began using Bamboo Health’s solution at the beginning of the year, while the other went live at the end of Q1.
</p><p>Within that time, both states successfully dispatched mobile response teams via the Crisis Management System to individuals experiencing behavioral health crises 4,395 times. Bamboo Health’s Crisis Management System supports regional call centers by coordinating the expected two-fold surge in call volume and expediting access to definitive assessment and treatment for those in crisis.
The Crisis Management System is built on the OpenBeds® platform, which creates a trusted coordinated care treatment network to track availability of behavioral health and substance use treatment facilities, including inpatient beds and outpatient treatment appointments.
"Bamboo Health is proud of our work to develop a comprehensive and integrated behavioral health crisis system that helps close gaps in care and makes it easier for individuals to get access to and receive the behavioral health help they need, when they need it most."</p>
