<p>Connect2MyDoctor, a telehealth platform by Melbourne-based health tech startup Neev Tech Labs, has launched a new three-dimensional/augmented reality module for patient education.
The web and mobile app-supported module called cARe enables specialists to easily explain anatomical structures and physiological mechanisms to patients through integrated AR.
Besides patient education, the cARe module can also be used for Continuing Professional Development and by Virtual Tumour Boards and medical colleges.
cARe, our 3D/AR module, can be a game changer not only in terms of patient experience but will also be a great engagement tool for hospitals.
Connect2MyDoctor is working on various next-gen AI technology tools taking the game beyond just video consulting, even as AR continues to transform telehealth and the in-patient consultation experience.</p>
