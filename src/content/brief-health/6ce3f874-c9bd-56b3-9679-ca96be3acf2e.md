<p>A survey conducted by the American Medical Association found that the vast majority of physician respondents say they're currently using telehealth – and many of those reporting a decrease say they're providing a mix of virtual and in-person care.
Among physician respondents, 85% indicate they currently use telehealth, with the majority of decreased use attributed to a mix of virtual and in-person visits.
Telephone and Zoom are still the primary platforms used to deliver care, and less than half of respondents report being able to access their telehealth platform via their electronic health record.
"Many of my patients are not that well versed in technology and telehealth is a real big challenge for them," said one respondent.
They are a large part of the care that we can provide to our patients, who have limited access to other digital technology, Wi-Fi, et cetera," said a respondent.
"Allowing patients to be in their home is a key component of making telehealth more accessible and convenient," said AMA in its survey report.</p>
