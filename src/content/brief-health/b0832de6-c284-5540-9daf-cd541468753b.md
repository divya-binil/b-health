<p>University College London (UCL) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are joining forces to launch a centre for digital innovation.
The centre, to be hosted at the IDEALondon technology hub, will help healthcare and education organisations to accelerate digital innovation and address global issues in the sectors.
UCL CDI director Graça Carvalho (UCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences) said: “This ambitious collaboration brings together the strength of UCL and AWS to build trust within digital innovation, allowing hospitals, universities, patients, students, research teams and UCL spinouts to use cloud-based technology to compete on a global stage.”
John Davies, director, regional government, UK, worldwide public sector at AWS, said: “By bringing together UCL’s world renowned academic rigour with AWS’ cloud technologies and culture of innovation, we hope to provide healthcare and education organisations with a springboard to help them to address some of the toughest challenges facing society right now.”</p>
