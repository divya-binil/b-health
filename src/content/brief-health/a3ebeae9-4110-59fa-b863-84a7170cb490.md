    da. Multiple electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane
    Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched. Eligible studies
    reported various implementations of value-based healthcare initiatives. A
    qualitative approach was used to analyze their outcome measurements.
    Outcomes were classified according to a tier-level hierarchy. In a radar
    chart, we compared literature to cases from Harvard Business Publishing. The
    value agenda effect reported was described in terms of its impact on each
    domain of the value equation. A total of 7,195 records were retrieved; 47
    studies were included. Forty studies used electronic health record systems
    for data origin. Only 16 used patient-reported outcome surveys to cover
    outcome tiers that are important to patients, and 3 reported outcomes to all
    6 levels of our outcome measures hierarchy. A considerable proportion of the
    studies (36%) reported results that contributed to value-based financial
    outcomes focused on cost savings. However, a gap remains in measuring
    outcomes that matter to patients. A more complete application of the value
    agenda by health organizations requires advances in technology and culture
    change management....
