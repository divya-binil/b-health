<p>LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bamboo Health™, formerly Appriss Health and PatientPing, a healthcare technology solutions company focused on fostering care collaboration and providing information and actionable insights across the entire continuum of care today announced its expanded partnership with the Iowa Board of Pharmacy to offer Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) integration within Iowa providers’ electronic health record (EHR) and pharmacy management systems.
Providers and dispensers across the state will now be able to access PMP data directly within clinical workflows through Bamboo Health’s PMP Gateway solution. In partnership with the Iowa Board of Pharmacy, Bamboo Health was able to launch the statewide PMP Gateway solution within two-and-a-half weeks, quickly integrating important data directly into providers’ electronic health records.
Through Bamboo Health and the Iowa Board of Pharmacy’s partnership, users will now be able to integrate the data into clinicians’ workflows through the PMP Gateway solution.
“We’re excited to expand our partnership with the Iowa Board of Pharmacy, allowing the state’s prescribers and dispensers real-time access to PMP data at the point of care,” said Rob Cohen, chief executive officer of Bamboo Health.</p>
