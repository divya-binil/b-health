<p>Hospital leaders face substantial challenges when it comes to aggregating and comparing vast datasets to identify and correct problems. The sheer magnitude of data is prompting these healthcare organizations to recognize this deficit in their existing systems. As they learn about the value and benefits of actionable analytics to address and solve problems in virtually every aspect of operations, they are adopting new technology that is now available. A key benefit is that these new platforms overlay current transactional systems to deliver a cleaner, smarter and cost-effective solution.</p><p>The consolidation of data required to perform actionable analytics, allows astute hospital leaders to efficiently retrieve, compare, reconcile and analyze all data through multiple platforms. Because there is no large upfront investment and no need to discard existing systems, this puts organization management in control of aggregating data, and detecting/resolving issues that impact revenue integrity, as well as clinical and operational performance.</p>
