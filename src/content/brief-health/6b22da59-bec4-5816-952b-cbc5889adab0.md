<p>The&nbsp;COVID-Collab research team at King’s College London have launched a free mobile app for digital detection of COVID-19.</p><p>The&nbsp;COVID-Collab research team at King’s College London have launched a free mobile app which will allow scientists to investigate the use of wearable devices and smartphones for digital detection of COVID-19, to understand how it spreads and how the pandemic affects people’s mental and physical health.</p><p>The researchers, funded by&nbsp;National Institute for Health Research&nbsp;(NIHR) Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre (BRC), created the&nbsp;<strong>Mass Science app</strong>&nbsp;that allows COVID-Collab study participants to connect wearables, such as Fitbit devices, and share data including heart rate, activity and sleep. Participants can also use the app to provide information on geographic location, mood, and mental health in addition to COVID-19 symptoms and a diagnosis if they have tested positive for the disease.</p><p><a href="https://www.healthtechdigital.com/can-wearables-like-fitbit-devices-be-used-to-help-detect-covid-19/">Read on healthtechdigital.com</a></p>
