<p>Toolkit provides resources on governance, implementation of solutions to reduce burden, and measurement of burden reduction.By 2025, the clinical documentation burden in EHRs should be reduced to 25% of its current level, according to an ambitious call to action issued in 2021 by a group of informaticists and other stakeholders to health systems and health IT suppliers. A toolkit has now been created by the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) 25x5 Task Force to help organisations reduce their paperwork requirements.The Toolkit aims to offer resources for governance of EHR optimisation, application of burden-reduction strategies, and burden-reduction measurement.The Toolkit starts off by pointing out that recent research has found that therapists spend a lot of time documenting. As a result, there are more mistakes made, unexpected consequences occur, and there is less time to spend with patients, their careers, and their families.</p>
