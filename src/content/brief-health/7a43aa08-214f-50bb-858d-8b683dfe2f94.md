<p>A healthcare infosec expert talks why CISOs and CIOs should prioritize unified endpoint management, what a UEM strategy looks like and much more. Through the epidemic, remote healthcare has undoubtedly gained popularity.

Security breaches can thrive in isolated healthcare institutions. These can be extremely dangerous, especially if private patient data is revealed. Tablets and smartphones have also evolved into tools for enabling better and quicker patient care as a result of the digital transformation of healthcare.
