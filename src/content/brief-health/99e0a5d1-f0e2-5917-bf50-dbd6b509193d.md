<p>The first-of-its-kind, Hello Heart’s ‘My Cholesterol’ allows users to easily track and understand their cholesterol levels, and provides personalized insights based on peer-reviewed, published recommendations, encouraging them to make positive lifestyle changes to improve their health.
Powered by behavioral science and personalized digital coaching, ‘My Cholesterol’ brings Hello Heart one step further in the company’s mission to empower people to have a holistic understanding of their cardiovascular health and how it can be better managed.
The addition of cholesterol-centric capabilities makes Hello Heart the only solution in the market that looks to manage all key heart health disease factors - blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes.
Through a connected device and mobile app, and using AI-based technology, Hello Heart helps people make better lifestyle choices by tracking blood pressure, pulse, medications, weight, activity, and now also cholesterol levels. Like many other aspects of heart health, the normal range of cholesterol readings, specifically high-density lipoprotein (HDL), is different for men and women, which is why Hello Heart’s new cholesterol feature provides a personalized, born-gender-based view of readings.
Cholesterol, along with hypertension, are critical risk factors for heart disease that are typically not well managed,” said Dr. Sanjeev Aggarwal, Medical Advisor at Hello Heart and former Chief of Cardiovascular Surgery at Beaumont Health.
Through a connected device and mobile app that uses AI, behavioral science, and personalized digital coaching to drive lifestyle changes, Hello Heart empowers people to embrace healthier behavior, which can reduce the risks of high blood pressure and heart disease.</p>
