<p>Changing pharma supply chain: the entire process will be affected by disruptive technologies like robotics, A.I. or blockchain.<br><br>Exoskeletons to aid pharma factory workers. 3D printing to allow pharmacies to produce drugs on the spot. Blockchain technologies to help fight counterfeit drugs.&nbsp;</p><p>These are just bits and pieces, but the entire process of the pharmaceutical supply chain will be affected by disruptive technologies. Let me show you how innovations will make it more efficient, faster and cheaper than ever before.</p><p>“<i>We call it Robi</i>”, the smiling pharmacist told me when I looked at the robotic dispenser pacing up and down in a small glass-fronted drug storage room of the pharmacy. The robot spares humans about two hours of medication stacking and distribution every single day. “<i>And it only makes mistakes if I make one. Or when there are too many requests at the same time” </i>– the pharmacist added. By leveraging robotic tools, pharmacies can reduce the time for monotonous tasks and shorten the waiting time. This one is just one tiny example of the zillions of solutions where robots improve the pharma supply chain.</p>
