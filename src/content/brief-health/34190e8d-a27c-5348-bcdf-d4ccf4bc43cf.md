<p>Appalachian Regional Healthcare (ARH), based in Lexington, Ky., will use Biofourmis’ virtual care and AI-based predictive analytics technology to support a new Rural Home Hospital program delivering acute hospital-level care inside patients’ homes–including a clinical trial studying this care model in rural areas.
The program will enable caregivers to deliver hospital-level care in patients’ homes across a range of acute conditions instead of admitting them to a medical facility.
Rural Home Hospital enables caregivers to deliver hospital-level care in patients’ homes across a range of acute conditions instead of admitting them to a medical facility.
For example, one randomized clinical trial leveraging Biofourmis’ technology found that a hospital at home program reduced hospital admissions among participating patients by 70% and lowered costs by nearly 40%.
For rural communities, home hospital programs also reduce patient and family travel burdens and out-of-pocket costs associated with facility-based care.</p>
