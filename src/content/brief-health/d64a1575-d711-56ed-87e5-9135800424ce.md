<p>A new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unfpa.org/sowmy">report</a> from the&nbsp;United Nations raises the alarm on the number of midwives, warning that millions of lives could be saved if the shortfall were addressed.</p><p>The acute shortage of 900,000 midwives represents a third of the required global midwifery workforce, says a study carried out jointly by the UN Population Fund, the World Health Organization and the International Confederation of Midwives. And as a result of this deficit, the lives of millions of women and newborn babies are at risk.</p><p><i>You might also like:&nbsp;</i>Despite recent progress, female labour participation in Pakistan stands at 25%. This is markedly lower than those of countries with similar gross national income per capita. While 80â€“85% of the students in medical colleges in Pakistan are girls, only 44% registered with the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) are female. Why is this so, and what is behind this phenomenon of doctor brides? <a href="https://healthmanagement.org/c/healthmanagement/issuearticle/sehat-kahani-addressing-the-social-phenomenon-of-doctor-brides">Learn more</a></p><p>"The Covid-19 crisis has only exacerbated these problems, with the health needs of women and newborns being overshadowed, midwifery services being disrupted and midwives being deployed to other health services," said a UN statement about the study covering 194 countries.</p><p>An analysis conducted for this report, published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30397-1/fulltext#:~:text=The%202014%20Lancet%20Series%20on,the%20level%20of%20intervention%20coverage.">the Lancet</a>&nbsp;last&nbsp;December, showed that fully resourcing midwife-delivered care by 2035 could avert 67 per cent of maternal deaths, 64 per cent of newborn deaths and 65 per cent of stillbirths, saving an estimated 4.3 million lives per year<br>&nbsp;</p>
