<p>Fertility care is expensive and often hard to access. OCA Ventures' Dana Sun and Ellen Bursey explain the digital health landscape and offer advice for investors and founders in the space. Reproductive healthcare is still dispersed, expensive, and unavailable. Startups working to fill care gaps have multiplied as a result of the absence of solutions to these issues. We extracted some tips for investors and founders in this field after talking with over 75 fertility tech businesses and doctors. Reproductive healthcare in the United States has difficulties due to a plethora of issues. The COVID-19 pandemic is making it difficult for hospitals to recuperate, and there is more pressure than ever to reduce expenses. Due to staffing constraints and relatively low reimbursement rates, obstetrics is typically not a lucrative area of business for hospitals. As a result, several hospitals are moving their volume mix to more lucrative treatments (i.e. knees, hips and spines). Sadly, this throws obstetrics on the scrap heap.</p>
