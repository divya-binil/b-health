<p>As a leading consumer-focused digital healthcare platform, GoodRx (Nasdaq: GDRX) today announced the launch of Provider Mode, a unique experience created especially for healthcare professionals (HCPs) to assist them in locating cost-effective options for the pharmaceuticals they recommend. Provider Mode provides specialised tools built by GoodRx's in-house team of medical experts and external healthcare provider focus groups to assist HCPs and office staff in supporting patients throughout their healthcare journey. To lessen the administrative load faced by the thousands of providers who already use GoodRx, Provider Mode was developed. On behalf of their patients, over 850,000 prescribers have utilised GoodRx to seek for drug costs, prescription savings, and reliable health information since June 2021.&nbsp;</p>
