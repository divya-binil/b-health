<p>In order to provide post-acute organisations and their residents with a win-win situation, K&amp;B Underwriters and VirtuSense Technologies have teamed. K&amp;B Underwriters' new CareAgents programme for post-acute healthcare providers went live on September 1st, 2022. With the continuous usage of VirtuSense technology on-site, this programme can offer a cheaper annual insurance premium, demonstrating a previously unheard-of confidence in AI technology's ability to prevent falls and minimise insurance claims. Through this special programme, businesses may use VirtuSense's predictive AI technology to reduce insurance costs, raise safety and quality standards, and safeguard residents without adding more workers. At its core, this cooperation assists organisations in gaining access to preventative care methods that safeguard residents. If we can encourage the adoption of modern technology that has been shown to prevent falls.</p>
