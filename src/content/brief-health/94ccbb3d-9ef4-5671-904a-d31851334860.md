<p>The triggering framework was designed to leverage existing EHR hooks and rules, making incremental deployment fast, easy, and reliable, explained Dr. Dan Lemkin, senior director of the Center for Tech Innovation at the University of Maryland Medical System/UMD School of Medicine.
For example, if you wish to be notified when patients meeting specific clinical criteria arrive in the ED, you can simply leverage a standard ADT arrival event to trigger an outbound secure message.
He added that because clinicians are inundated with information constantly, if you blast people with alerts which are not providing them actionable information, you are just creating more noise.</p>
