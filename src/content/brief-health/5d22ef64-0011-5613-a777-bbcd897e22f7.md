<p>Te Whata Ora Waikato, formerly the Waikato District Health Board, has tapped Altera Digital Health to implement a full suite of cloud-based anaesthesia information management tools from healthcare technology provider Provation to replace the old paper-based processes in its health services. Based on a media release, Altera will be delivering the Provation iPro Anaesthesia system to the Waikato Hospital and Thames Hospital, which collectively run 34 operating theatres and 37 PACU beds.
Altera bagged the contract to digitise the hospitals' perioperative processes from an open market process initiated by Te Whatu Ora Waikato, the health district which serves a population of more than 425,000. In a statement, Altera said it will work closely with local health authorities and clinicians to configure the iPro Anaesthesia system to "reflect local practices and nomenclature".</p>
