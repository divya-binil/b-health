<p>Wearable blood pressure monitors have been the Achilles heels of the digital health revolution, while we desperately need reliable, comfortable devices. At least one significant area of the digital health revolution has lagged behind: blood pressure monitoring. Traditional cuffs were the only options available on the market for a very long period. Even the first smartwatches were bulky and difficult to wear (like the Omron model I examined). Therefore, it was time for businesses to understand that photoplethysmography (PPG) is the future of BP monitoring. PPG is a non-invasive optical method for determining changes in blood volume in tissue's microvascular bed. It operates by shining a light on the skin, then detecting changes in light intensity brought on by differences in blood flow. The light is absorbed and scattered by the blood as it flows through the blood vessels.</p>
