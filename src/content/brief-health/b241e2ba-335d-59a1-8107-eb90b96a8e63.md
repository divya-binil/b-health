<p>The Hippocratic Oath is the most famous text in Western medicine.
At the dawn of a new era in medicine, it is high time to rewrite the Oath so that it would reflect the state of technological development, changes in social structures and in general, the requirements of the 21st century.
What is the Hippocratic Oath?
Used by many medical schools at graduation ceremonies, the medical profession adopted the Oath of Hippocrates as its ethical code of conduct centuries ago.
Still, statistics show that the majority of medical schools incorporate some kind of oath, giving ethical guidelines to future doctors.
The principles of the Hippocratic Oath – renewed
The Hippocratic Oath should reflect that.
Physicians need to acknowledge the raison d’etre of technologies in healing, and one of the means to assume its rightful place in medicine starts with its inclusion into the Hippocratic Oath.</p>
