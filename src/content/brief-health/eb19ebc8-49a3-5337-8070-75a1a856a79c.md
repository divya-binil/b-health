<p>According to a recent study by the Universität Politècnica de Valencia and WHO in the International Journal of Medical Informatics, artificial intelligence (AI) is driving a new revolution in medicine and the health care industry, primarily for image analysis and disease modelling, but its impact on people's health is still limited. &nbsp;</p><p>AI is utilized in healthcare in a variety of settings, including molecular and genetic testing, medical imaging, analysis of diagnostic codes, and the prediction of infectious disease outbreaks as part of health emergency protection schemes. The paper notes that, "Despite the great advances and the high level of maturity of AI in certain clinical domains, the review of systematic reviews remains limited and is typically only used in laboratories and testing."</p><p><a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/27-09-2022-use-of-artificial-intelligence-on-the-rise--but-its-impact-on-health-still-limited--new-study-finds">Read on who.int</a></p>
