<p>Carium, a leading virtual care platform, announced it launched an integration with an electronic health record (EHR) at the Institute for Population Health (IPH) in less than four weeks in partnership with Smartlink Health Solutions.
By integrating the virtual care platform with their EHR, they streamline workflows, and positively impact the care team and patient experiences. Physicians at IPH click-to-order virtual services like RPM directly through their EHR, seamlessly enrolling patients to Carium.
Within the technology's complete virtual care ecosystem, easy real-time sharing of data and patient engagement prevents silos in healthcare.
Carium's comprehensive, configurable platform is a complete virtual care ecosystem connecting care teams to the people that they serve in real time and within real life.</p>
