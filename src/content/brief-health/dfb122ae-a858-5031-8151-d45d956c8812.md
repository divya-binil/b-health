<p>Taking the time to proactively prepare for your virtual second opinion can help you gather all the information needed to make an informed decision about your treatment.<br><br>If you’ve been diagnosed with a serious, rare, or complex health condition or your doctor has recommended surgery as a treatment option, your next step should be to get a second opinion on both your diagnosis and treatment options. There are several reasons to seek a second opinion. First, it’s important to understand all the treatments that are appropriate for your condition. A second opinion can also lower your risk of being misdiagnosed, experiencing a medical error or receiving inappropriate treatment.</p>
