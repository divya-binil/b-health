<p>Independent study found that most patients who were not satisfied with their current treatment recommendations made changes after getting a second opinion via telehealth. Patients are generally more at ease than ever seeking telemedicine assistance and care thanks to the pandemic's growth in telehealth. Virtual care prospects will continue to change traditional healthcare in 2023 and beyond because patients can use telehealth to have more access to specialists who can assist them address serious health concerns - regardless of their locations. At The Clinic by Cleveland Clinic, which offers virtual second opinions service and direct access to doctors, Gokce Sezgin is the head of marketing and patient liaisons. We spoke with Sezgin to find out how virtual second opinions have increased health equity and how the telehealth platform fits into clinical workflows and collects patient data in the background. Access to patient records can be extremely helpful in providing second opinions for medical diagnoses and treatment plans. Here are some ways in which access to patient records can assist with second opinions:</p><ul><li>Understanding the patient's medical history: Access to patient records allows a second opinion provider to review the patient's medical history, including previous diagnoses, medications, and treatments. This information can provide valuable context for understanding the patient's current condition and can help the second opinion provider identify any potential issues with the previous diagnosis or treatment plan.</li><li>Reviewing diagnostic tests: Access to patient records also allows a second opinion provider to review any diagnostic tests that have been performed, such as blood tests, X-rays, or MRIs. This can help the provider confirm or refute the original diagnosis and identify any additional issues that may have been missed.</li><li>Identifying potential treatment options: By reviewing the patient's medical history and diagnostic tests, a second opinion provider can identify potential treatment options that may not have been considered by the original provider. This can be especially helpful for complex or rare medical conditions where multiple treatment options may be available.</li><li>Providing a fresh perspective: Finally, having access to patient records can provide a second opinion provider with a fresh perspective on the patient's condition. By reviewing the patient's medical history and diagnostic tests, the provider can approach the case with a new set of eyes and potentially identify issues or treatment options that were not previously considered.</li></ul>
