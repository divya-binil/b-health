<p>Design thinking is key to creating successful digital tools that are helpful for patients, said Molly Woodriff, MPH, senior product manager at NYU Langone Health at HIMSS21.<br><br>Innovation is a hot buzzword in healthcare, and <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/more-mega-deals-table-2021-has-already-surpassed-last-years-funding-total-says-rock-health">digital health investment</a> is booming. But how can the industry create successful tools that are actually useful for patients?</p><p>”There’s an opportunity here to both succeed and to fail,” said Molly Woodriff, MPH, senior product manager at NYU Langone Health, during her presentation at <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/himss-coverage">HIMSS21</a>:&nbsp;"Design thinking is something that can really increase your chances of success in innovation.”</p><p>Design thinking is a human-centered process for problem-solving, said Woodriff. She believes NYU Langone’s use of design thinking has set them apart from other health systems in the digital health space, allowing them to create a range of tools from virtual urgent care to MyWall, a <a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/nyu-langone-pushes-boundaries-integrated-technology">digital hub for inpatients</a>.</p><p>The process includes six steps: Empathize and understand your users, define your problem, generate ideas to solve your issue, create a prototype of your best ideas, test your concept to get feedback from users&nbsp;and implement your solution, while continually measuring success.</p><p>The goal is to design for the user’s experience, not just design a product. Woodriff used the example of the classic glass Heinz bottle that required a lot of smacking and shaking to get the ketchup out of the bottle. The newer, squeezable bottle with the opening at the bottom worked better for what people actually needed to do: get ketchup on their fries.</p>
