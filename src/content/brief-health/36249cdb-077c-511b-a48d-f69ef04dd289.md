<p>Healthcare lawyers weigh in about how to come into compliance with the Office of the National Coordinator of Health IT's rules. "Information blocking is a practice that interferes with access, exchange, or use of electronic health information, unless the practice is required by law or falls under an exception," explained Adam Greene, partner at Davis Wright Tremaine.
"That being said, a healthcare provider is only information blocking if it knows its practice is unreasonable," Greene continued.
"One common misconception is that the information blocking rule requires you to proactively post electronic health information to a patient portal, without first receiving a request to do so," explained Greene.</p>
