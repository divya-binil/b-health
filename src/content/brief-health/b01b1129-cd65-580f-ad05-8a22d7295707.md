<p>Amazon's Alexa has joined the vaccine conversation. As of today, the technology is able to answer questions about COVID-19 immunization sites and eligibility.&nbsp;The data is powered by&nbsp;<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.vaccinefinder.org_&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=JHHkSQuaqwDHGORnIQuaBw&amp;r=5YOstc0lpYlXTEVRRvNnZYh_BZACLPEaOBCYPMI7MEo&amp;m=IE1_KPJGf6uR1mtA8v1YZGNx1nmmQ4oQW5R29vdAVcI&amp;s=i7hmmwq6cwBhVjYbQINi3XtEcRkRLNNV-V706AqSgwo&amp;e=">VaccineFinder</a>, a tool created by Boston Children's Hospital with CDC support.&nbsp;</p><p>When a user asks Alexa about COVID-19 vaccinations in their area, the technology can reply with a list of centers in close proximity. Users are then able to instruct Alexa to call one of the centers that have been listed, according to an Amazon release.</p><p>Alexa is also programmed to tell users about vaccine availability and eligibility requirements in 85 countries. &nbsp;</p><p>Beyond vaccinations, Alexa is also able to help users find COVID-19 testing centers close to them. As with vaccinations, Alexa is able to connect users to a testing site.</p>
