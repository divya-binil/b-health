<p>The headline of this article previously referred to Doximity as a startup. In actuality, it is a publicly traded firm rather than a startup. Doximity, a digital health platform, is fundamentally similar to LinkedIn for physicians. Though possibly not a precise one-to-one comparison, the broad strokes are undoubtedly present. Doximity describes itself as "the professional medical network for physicians" on its website, which also claims to be the largest community of its kind in the country. The company, which was founded in 2010, has roughly two million users. According to Doximity, the service has verified 80% of physicians as well as 50% of nurse practitioners and physician assistants. Doximity asserts that the number of its members exceeds that of the real American Medical Association.</p>
