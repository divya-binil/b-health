<p>The significance of comprehending the causes of the partial character of procedures that are reimbursed at reduced rates is stressed by Dr. Gupta. He advises participants to think about whether the failure to complete these procedures was brought on by circumstances relating to the patient, the provider, or the environment in which the treatments were performed.

The essay also raises issues with relation to how procedures are planned. Dr. Gupta advises looking into any problems with the preparation procedure itself.
