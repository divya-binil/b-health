<p>A hospital CEO with competing interests intended to put a surgical group out of business, highlighting the profit-driven nature of healthcare and the pressures facing independent medical practices. He mistreated us. I slumped gradually further into my chair as I made an effort to process the letter the CEO of the nearby hospital had sent to our group. "We appreciate your group's interest in visiting our hospital. I appreciate your steadfast commitment to providing for our patients. But our organisation has made the decision to go a different course. I hope your practise has success. He had come up to us several months prior, grinning like the Grinch, and spoke to us about "joining his team." To be the next domino to fall was our practise. We didn't trust him from the start because of his intentions. His performances over the past twenty years have been at best average when it came to keeping his promises to doctors. Small-town doctors have long memories.</p>
