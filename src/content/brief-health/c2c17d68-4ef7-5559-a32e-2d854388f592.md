"There are a bunch of different questions about where the risks and liabilities might arise."&nbsp;</p><p>Fisher, who is moderating a panel on the subject at the <a href="https://www.himss.org/event-machine-learning-ai-healthcare">HIMSS Machine Learning &amp; AI for Healthcare</a>&nbsp;event this December, described two main areas of legal concern: cybersecurity and bias.&nbsp;(HIMSS is the parent organization of <i>Healthcare IT News</i>.)</p>
