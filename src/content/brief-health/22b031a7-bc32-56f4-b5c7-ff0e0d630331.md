<p>Employers will have access to Teladoc's virtual primary care services through HealthJoy's care navigation platform. The virtual primary care services are now part of the cooperation between Chicago-based Teladoc Health and the digital employee benefits platform HealthJoy. Employers can navigate their benefits through HealthJoy, which also provides online services for dermatology, adult and adolescent mental health, physical therapy, urgent care, nutrition, and cigarette cessation. In order to integrate a virtual medical care option within HealthJoy's care navigation platform, Teladoc and HealthJoy formed a cooperation in 2022. Teladoc's virtual primary care services are completely integrated into HealthJoy's employer-focused offerings thanks to the expanded relationship announced today. This is a crucial step in our effort to make it easier for employees to stay healthy and well by enhancing access to primary care and streamlining the benefits navigation process.</p>
