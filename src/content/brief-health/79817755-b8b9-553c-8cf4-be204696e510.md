<p>Experts from IQVIA say increasing diversity of data sources improves access to care and exposes obstacles to access in a quantifiable and timely fashion.<br><br>Adam Mariano, vice president of Health Innovation at IQVIA, and David Voccola, senior director of global strategic planning for the integrated health practice at IQVIA, discussed the importance of having a variety of data sources, what needs to happen to make patient-generated data more readily available for researchers and how this data can impact innovation in care delivery.
And when we understand more of the nonclinical reasons participants do or not succeed in clinical research engagements, we can reduce bias in research participation, have more representative data available for regulatory decision-making, and generate more equitable outcomes in care delivery.
Q. What needs to happen to make patient-generated data more readily available for researchers and innovators?
A. The increasing ubiquity of healthcare data standards, like HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources in care delivery, research and even consumer spaces is empowering a new generation of interoperable use cases leveraging both clinic- and patient-generated data.
Q. How can patient-generated data help inform regulatory decision-making and impact innovation in care delivery?
A. Standalone patient-reported data has traditionally been underutilized in both care-delivery and clinical research settings.
The same is true in care delivery, where the ability to pair patient-generated and/or reported data with secondary data from care delivery has the potential to revolutionize decision support, quality improvement, and digital guideline development.</p>
