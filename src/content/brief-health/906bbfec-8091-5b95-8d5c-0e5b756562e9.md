    description: >-
      A virtual health solution built with purpose. Founded by a group of
      innovative emergency medicine physicians and healthcare entrepreneurs,
      we're on a mission to simplify people's lives by delivering reliable,
      trusted medical care anytime and anywhere, to ultimately foster healthier
      communities and workplaces.


      Our journey began when co-founder and chief medical officer, Dr. Bobby
      Park, received a call about a cut that his niece had sustained. It was
      after hours for the pediatrician and urgent care center, and his sister
      didn't know if it required emergency care. Dr. Park was able to examine
      the wound via video on his smartphone, determine it wasn't serious, and
      provide care instructions. No emergency visit was necessary, saving his
      sister lots of time and money.

<p><i><strong>Troy University Introduced as Partner with Monthly Services Now Available for Students</strong></i></p><p><strong>CHAPEL HILL, N.C. – (March 8, 2021) – </strong>RelyMD, a digital health company that provides on-demand telehealth services, announced a new way for patient groups to receive care. Through its MYidealDOCTOR brand, organizations can now provide their group members with a <a href="https://www.myidealdoctor.com/membership-program">monthly subscription service</a> available at an affordable rate.</p><p>Additionally, RelyMD is excited to welcome Troy University as the first partner of the new subscription service. Troy University, an Alabama university with 4 campuses and online courses, will provide all students with the option of a monthly subscription to <a href="https://www.myidealdoctor.com/troy">Troy University Virtual Care</a>.

The monthly subscription service is highly customizable and can include:</p><ul><li>Custom market pricing</li><li>Revenue-sharing opportunities</li><li>Branded registration page</li><li>Reporting dashboard</li><li>Marketing resources</li></ul><p>“Lower overall healthcare costs are a clear advantage for anyone choosing telehealth,” said David Levin, CEO of RelyMD and MYidealDOCTOR. “Troy University has taken a powerful action in creating a unique service for their students to access 24/7 care at a lower cost than typically available through emergency departments and urgent care facilities. We’re excited to be partnering with such a forward-thinking university as they look to provide additional benefits to their students during a time when it’s more important than ever.”</p><p><strong>About RelyMD</strong></p><p>RelyMD is a growing digital health company that coordinates telehealth solutions to health systems, managed care organizations, and employers.
