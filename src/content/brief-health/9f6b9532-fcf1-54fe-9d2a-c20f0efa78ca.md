<p>As the rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine nears, the industry must have a robust strategy in place to manage coronavirus immunizations effectively. That means patients will have to be accurately identified and consistently matched to their health records so providers can track who has received a vaccine and who hasn’t.</p><p>The issue of patient identification becomes even more complex as a number of vaccines enter the market at the same time; each with their own set of schedules for administering. Many will require more than one dose. Multiple doses and different vaccines not only pose logistical concerns, but serious health and safety implications as well.</p>
