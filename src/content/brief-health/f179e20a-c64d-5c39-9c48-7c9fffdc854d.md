Their healthcare delivery is undergoing a transition that will affect all stakeholders, including patients, providers, and those responsible for planning, operating, and financing the health system. The key initiatives for the Department of Health - Abu Dhabi are to improve care quality, expand care access, shift from public to private providers, and implement a new financing model through mandatory health insurance. In the fight against COVID-19, the UAE has the world’s highest percentage of fully vaccinated residents. </p><p> "We're thrilled to collaborate with ADIO to bring our technology and talent to Abu Dhabi, which is a driving force for innovation in the region," said Sandeep Gupta, cofounder and COO at Innovaccer. "The challenges healthcare faces are global. Spiralling costs and the pandemic have motivated markets around the world to improve the clinical and financial performance of their healthcare systems. Through this collaboration, we will accelerate healthcare transformation in the Middle East to meet the public's needs and expectations for accessible, affordable, high-quality care. Our technology plays an instrumental role in helping healthcare stakeholders succeed in highly complex, highly regulated, and increasingly consumerised markets. Now we’re bringing our proven platform to Abu Dhabi to drive global healthcare data innovation and help accelerate the region's transition from volume to value.” </p><p> Eng. Abdulla Abdul Aziz AlShamsi, acting director general of ADIO, said, “ADIO seeks partnerships with transformative companies that are driving positive change within their sectors. Innovaccer’s mission to transform healthcare data access and usability will be accelerated by its expansion to Abu Dhabi, with the emirate’s innovation ecosystem and established healthcare infrastructure and networks providing the ideal base to achieve growth and regional success.” </p><p> The Innovaccer<sup>Ⓡ</sup> Health Cloud and its Data Activation Platform enable healthcare organisations to accelerate value-based transformation by rapidly integrating data from disparate IT systems, care settings, and community sources (e.g., Social Determinants of Health) to create a unified, longitudinal patient record. This single source of patient truth helps organisations improve quality and lower costs with seamless workflows and real-time insights that support evidence-based, integrated, and coordinated care; help better manage costs and risk; and foster patient engagement strategies that facilitate patient-centred, equitable care. </p><p> Innovaccer’s solutions have been implemented in more than 1,600 care settings in the U.S., and have created unified patient records for more than 39 million patients, helping over 96,000 providers save more than $1 billion and work more collaboratively and insightfully at the point of care. </p><p> Innovaccer’s solutions continue to earn accolades and awards from leading industry analysts, including the <a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" target="_blank" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finnovaccer.com%2Fawards%2Fbest-in-klas-data-platform&amp;esheet=52935731&amp;newsitemid=20221004005578&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Best+in+KLAS&amp;index=9&amp;md5=0a0f152318da34c3680a75e299dfe11a" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Best in KLAS</a> healthcare data and analytics platform, <a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" target="_blank" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finnovaccer.com%2Fawards%2FKLAS-recognizes-Innovaccer-in-Population-Health-Management&amp;esheet=52935731&amp;newsitemid=20221004005578&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Best+in+KLAS&amp;index=10&amp;md5=b21053ed5b8be56a658e7d651772f7b7" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Best in KLAS</a> in population health management, <a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" target="_blank" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20220316005614%2Fen%2FInnovaccer%25E2%2580%2599s-Data-Activation-Platform-Ranked-No.-1-End-to-End-Hospital-System-Population-Health-Technology-Platform-in-Black-Book-2022-User-Survey&amp;esheet=52935731&amp;newsitemid=20221004005578&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Black+Book%26%238217%3Bs&amp;index=11&amp;md5=5f55b59362497ac058dc7c4abb8ef188" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Black Book’s</a> #1 ranking End-to-End Hospital System Population Health Technology, <a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" target="_blank" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finnovaccer.com%2Fbest-in-klas-data-platform&amp;esheet=52935731&amp;newsitemid=20221004005578&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Black+Book%26%238217%3Bs&amp;index=12&amp;md5=224805b1a6b1bdb77751a45e6f5c61a0" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Black Book’s</a> #1 ranking for Data Activation Platforms and Healthcare Data Integration Systems, the leading Population Health Management vendor recognised by <a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" target="_blank" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finnovaccer.com%2Fnews%2Finnovaccer-recognized-as-a-flagship-vendor-in-the-latest-chilmark-report&amp;esheet=52935731&amp;newsitemid=20221004005578&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Chilmark&amp;index=13&amp;md5=0788e5c44f8503f551cd2da1bbaeb43a" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Chilmark</a>, and the <a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" target="_blank" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finnovaccer.com%2Fnews%2Finnovaccer-wins-ucsf-health-award-for-patient-cost-savings&amp;esheet=52935731&amp;newsitemid=20221004005578&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=UCSF+Health+Award&amp;index=14&amp;md5=b776f726923062c5c82febec83276dc0" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">UCSF Health Award</a> for “Patient Cost Savings”—to name but a few. </p><p> “This is an important milestone not just for us as a company, but for global healthcare,” Gupta said. “We’re unwavering in our mission to connect and curate the world’s healthcare information to make it accessible and useful.
