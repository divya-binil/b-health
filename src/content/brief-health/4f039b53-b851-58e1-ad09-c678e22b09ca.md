<p>Hospital leaders might want to avoid using one of these seven phrases to sound more confident at work, according to a Nov. 7 report by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/07/overused-words-and-phrases-that-make-you-sound-weak-less-confident-according-to-grammar-experts.html"><i>CNBC</i></a><i> </i>contributors.</p><p>Instead, hospital leaders should consider saying: "What are your thoughts?" or "I'd like your input on this."
Instead, the Petrases urge others to say: "Let's try" or "It's a good idea to try ..."
The phrase means you're not going to say something but then say something anyway.
It is a filler phrase that means nothing and some people find it irritating.</p>
