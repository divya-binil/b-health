<p>Researchers from the National Robotarium, a partnership between Heriot-Watt University and the University of Edinburgh, industry partners and Edinburgh-based clinicians are creating a new robot-assisted surgery technique to improve cancer surgical outcomes and patient care.
However, when undertaking ‘keyhole surgery’ using laparoscopic, endoscopic (flexible telescope) or robotic operations, surgeons can’t use ‘feel’ to determine tissue characteristics.
This will effectively eliminate the margin of error for surgeons, giving them confidence that they have removed the correct amount of tissue during the operation itself and reduce the need for further invasive surgery for patients.”
“Currently, although surgeons use detailed preoperative scans to decide on surgical margins during surgery, they also use vision and ‘feel’ to distinguish normal and abnormal tissue.
We believe this new technique will restore ‘feel’ to surgeons doing robotic surgery, allowing greater precision through accurate assessment, hugely benefiting patients and significantly limiting repeat surgery and the need for additional treatments.”
The National Robotarium is supported by £21 million from the UK Government and £1.4 million from the Scottish Government through the £1.3 billion Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal – a 15 year investment programme jointly funded by both governments and regional partners.
I’m proud we are supporting the development of world-leading surgical robots through our £21 million investment in the National Robotarium as part of the UK Government’s £1.7 billion programme of levelling up in Scotland.</p>
