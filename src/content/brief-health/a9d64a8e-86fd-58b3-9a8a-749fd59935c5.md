<p>In 2021 our hard work was further validated when digital health leader Amwell acquired SilverCloud.
This was a defining moment in our journey, by becoming part of the Amwell family, we had an opportunity to accelerate our Mission of Helping people improve their mental health through technology.
By combining the power of SilverCloud’s digital mental health tools, courses and support with Amwell’s digital care delivery enablement platform, we can redefine the practice of medicine to include always-on healthcare companionship that makes the balance and transition between interactive, digital and in-person care more fluid across the full spectrum of care.
That means over one million people, their families, workplaces and communities have felt the positive impact of SilverCloud on their journey to better mental health.
2019/2020: SilverCloud collaborates with Microsoft to conduct research that combines Microsoft’s cutting-edge machine learning and AI technologies with SilverCloud’s expertise in real-world delivery of evidence-based interventions and mental health outcomes.
2022: Amwell announces Comprehensive Behavioral Health offering combining the best of SilverCloud digital care and Amwell therapy delivery and its 50 sate network.
2022: SilverCloud surpasses one million users of its digital mental health platform.</p>
