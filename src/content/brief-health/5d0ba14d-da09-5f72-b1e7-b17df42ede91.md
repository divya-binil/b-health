<p>Precision genomics medicine is a customized medical approach that focuses on identifying and optimizing medical treatments and medical-prevention solutions based on individuals’ genomic profiling.
The basis of precision medicine is the human genome, whose study and understanding allow scientists and medical professionals to better comprehend the impact of its variations on people’s health.
All this was possible thanks to genomics’ ability to assess the genetic variables that influence the evolution and treatment of a disease such as breast cancer.
Genomics also provides essential information that enables medical professionals to recommend treatments and prescribe drugs personalized to the patient’s molecular profiling.
Precision genomics medicine can recognize a disease long before the symptoms appear.
Precision genomics medicine enables the correct diagnosing of a disease when symptoms begin to develop.</p>
