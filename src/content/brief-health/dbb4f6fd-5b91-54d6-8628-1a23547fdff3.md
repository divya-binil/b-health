<p>The Apple Watch is capable of scanning for&nbsp;heart conditions and calling for help after injuries. But Apple is working on a deeper set of&nbsp;features as part of the tech giant's bigger ambitions in health monitoring.</p><p>Apple is working on new health-related features for its smartwatch, including a tool for blood pressure measurement and a thermometer to help with fertility planning, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-blood-pressure-measure-wrist-thermometer-in-watch-11630501201"><strong>The Wall Street Journal reported</strong></a> Wednesday, citing people familiar with the plans and internal company documents.</p><p>The fertility feature could be available as soon as next year, along with potential improvements to the Apple Watch's irregular heartbeat monitoring, WSJ reporter Rolfe Winkler wrote.</p><p>The company is expected to release&nbsp;its seventh version of the Apple Watch&nbsp;in the coming weeks, but most of its more ambitious health-related improvements aren’t expected before 2022.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/competing-apple-and-fitbit-amazon-launches-health-wearable-tracks-activity-body-fat-and"><strong>Competing with Apple and Fitbit, Amazon launches health wearable that tracks activity, body fat, emotions</strong></a></p><p>According to internal documents and people familiar with Apple's plans, the tech giant has broader ambitions for its&nbsp;smartwatch, including the ability to detect sleep apnea, provide medical guidance when it senses low blood oxygen levels and, perhaps one day, spot diabetes, per the WSJ article.</p><p>For the blood pressure measurement feature, the company is studying a way to measure&nbsp;the speed of the wave a heartbeat sends through a person’s arteries using sensors in the Apple Watch, Winkler reported.</p><p>Apple has been steadily building out the health features of its smartwatch. In 2018, the latest iteration of Apple’s smartwatch included&nbsp;an <a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/new-apple-watch-receives-fda-clearance-for-built-ecg"><strong>FDA-cleared electrocardiogram</strong></a>, officially classifying it as a medical device capable of alerting its user to abnormal heart rhythms.</p><p>The company's Apple Watch Series 6, rolled out last year,&nbsp;expanded&nbsp;the health capabilities of previous Apple Watch models with a new feature that measures the oxygen saturation of the user’s blood.</p><p>Fitbit also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/fitbit-s-ecg-smartwatch-app-gets-fda-nod-to-track-heart-rhythm-irregularity"><strong>gained medical device clearances</strong></a>&nbsp;in the U.S. and Europe for its smartwatch electrocardiogram app&nbsp;to track users'&nbsp;heart rhythms for signs of atrial fibrillation.&nbsp;Some&nbsp;Fitbit&nbsp;devices offer a temperature tracking feature,&nbsp;using&nbsp;a&nbsp;sensor&nbsp;to estimate a user's&nbsp;personal baseline skin temperature. Fitbit devices also can track advanced sleep patterns at night.</p><p>Along with blood pressure measurements, there have been rumors that Apple has been working to include&nbsp;blood sugar readings and&nbsp;hydration level measurements from the&nbsp;wrist-worn gadget.</p><p>The tech giant works with sensor maker Rockley Photonics, which produces&nbsp;light-based sensors that operate similarly to the technology already built into the underside of the Apple Watch, with more basic hardware for measuring heartbeats, body temperature and oxygen saturation.</p>
