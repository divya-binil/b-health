<p>Over the past few weeks, several articles have emerged citing the troubling physician burnout statistics revealed by the <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/838437">2015 Medscape Physician Lifestyle Report</a> (see the Infographic included in this article). In short, 46% of all physicians surveyed say they are burned out. This represents a nearly seven percent increase in physician burnout rates since Medscape last conducted this survey in 2013.</p><p>There are several factors contributing to the rise in physician burnout — everything from insufficient income due to reimbursement cuts to doctors spending too much time at work. However, when you look closely at the data, one can’t help but recognize the negative impact the drive towards IT adoption is having on physician burnout.</p>
