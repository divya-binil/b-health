<p>The Lark Heart Health programme, an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven programme for lifestyle modification, was developed by Lark Health in partnership with Roche Diagnostics in 2021. With the use of virtual coaching, this programme seeks to help patients manage and prevent major risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).In the US, heart disease is the primary cause of death, accounting for about 1 in 5 fatalities.1 There were 121.5 million persons who had cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 2016.2 &nbsp;This figure is expected to increase to 131.2 million by 2035, which represents 45% of the US population.3 This raises the need for a solution that actively involves patients in reducing and managing their CVD risk.
