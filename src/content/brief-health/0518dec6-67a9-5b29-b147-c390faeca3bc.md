<p>Also: Healthcare professional networking and data platform H1 adds another $23 million to its Series C round, and chronic condition management company DarioHealth secures a loan facility of up to $50 million. Home and community value-based care startup CareBridge scooped up $140 million in a new funding round led by Oak HC/FT, bringing its valuation to more than $1 billion.
CareBridge will use the financing to expand geographically, continue building its home and community-based care database and add services to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
"CareBridge is revolutionizing care for individuals on Medicaid receiving home and community-based services," Brad Smith, executive chairman of CareBridge, said in a statement.
Healthcare professional networking and data platform H1 announced an extension to its Series C round, bringing its total to $123 million.</p>
