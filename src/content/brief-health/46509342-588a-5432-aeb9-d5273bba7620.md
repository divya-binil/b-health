<p>As healthcare costs&nbsp;continue to soar&amp; | Healthcare costs continue to soar and profits continue to stagnate. Faulty claims processing is partly to blame. Learn the best practices for prepayment claims editing.<br><br>As healthcare costs&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/about/research/trends-health-care-spending#:~:text=Health%20spending%20in%20the%20U.S.,in%202017%20(4.3%20percent).">continue to soar</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/hospitals/kaufman-hall-hospitals-close-out-2020-declining-margins-and-higher-expenses-due-to-covid">profits continue to stagnate</a>, some of the blame can certainly be attributed to faulty claims processing. In fact, ineffective claims editing can lead to a cascade of expensive problems (e.g., high error rates, inaccurate and inconsistent assessment of claims, penalties for regulatory noncompliance, unnecessary overhead, and fraud and litigation costs).&nbsp;<br><br>The numbers are staggering.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/medical-billing-errors-growing-says-medical-billing-advocates-of-america.html">80% of all claims</a>&nbsp;containing coding or other errors</li><li><a href="https://www.ajmc.com/view/medical-claim-denial-rates-rising-highest-in-initial-covid-19-hotspots">86% of denials</a>&nbsp;are potentially avoidable and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ajmc.com/view/medical-claim-denial-rates-rising-highest-in-initial-covid-19-hotspots">34% are absolutely avoidable</a></li><li>Almost&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hfma.org/topics/hfm/2018/september/61778.html">65% of claim denials</a>&nbsp;are never resubmitted</li></ul><p>Moreover, the ability to attract and retain participating providers depends largely on the payer’s ability to process and settle claims quickly and accurately.&nbsp;<br><br>Chasing claims revenue is labor-intensive, laborious, and costly. That’s why finding a solution that maintains payer rules while allowing for custom rule creation is a necessity when evaluating clinical coding and editing software.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Best Practices for Claims Editing</strong><br><br>Once you’ve selected the right clinical coding and editing software for your organization, it’s time to start implementing.
