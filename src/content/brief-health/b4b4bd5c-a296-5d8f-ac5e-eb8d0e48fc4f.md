<p>All vendors are struggling to provide training that meets the needs of small hospitals, researchers say, and while some fail to deliver on product functionality promises, others earn praise for their transparency. KLAS researchers spoke with small hospitals (250 beds or fewer) about their experiences in order to aid small healthcare organisations in making more informed decisions about their electronic health records and patient accounting systems. They discovered notable differences from comparable reports in recent years. According to the new Small-Hospital Patient Accounting report from the KLAS Arch Collaboration, small hospitals are altering their EHRs and patient accounting systems more frequently than their major hospital counterparts. The connection, product, culture, operations, and value pillars of the company's customer experience were all reviewed by KLAS researchers. Relationships, product functioning, culture, and value were all topics of research. Across these areas, the vendors Epic, Meditech, CPSI, and Oracle Health varried. Also, the report includes Medhost and athenahealth score information.</p>
