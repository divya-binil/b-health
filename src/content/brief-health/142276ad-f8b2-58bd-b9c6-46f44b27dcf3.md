<p>Healthcare automation startup Olive is laying off about 450 workers, according to an email sent by CEO Sean Lane to employees on Tuesday. Lane wrote the company had grown quickly over the past several years, hiring new staffers and launching new tools.
The layoffs come about a year after Olive announced it had closed a $400 million funding round that boosted its valuation to $4 billion.
Diagnostics company Cue Health, hybrid provider Carbon Health, primary care company Forward and mental health startup Cerebral have also laid off employees.</p>
