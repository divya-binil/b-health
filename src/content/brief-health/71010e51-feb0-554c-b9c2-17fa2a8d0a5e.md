<p><strong>Presidential race</strong></p><p>The race for the presidency and control of the Senate were undecided on Election Day, leaving big questions about the nation's direction on healthcare policy unanswered.</p><p>President Donald Trump won the battleground states of Texas and Florida that Democrats had hoped to flip, and either party's chance for victory runs through key states in the Midwest that have not yet reported final results. Several GOP Senate incumbents held onto their seats, narrowing the potential margin of power for either party.&nbsp;</p><p>Early results signal that Democrats have a possible but <a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/politics-policy/healthcare-policy-agendas-will-be-driven-congressional-state-elections">narrow path to a trifecta government</a> that could lead to major policy change on healthcare coverage and prescription drug costs.&nbsp;</p><p>President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden have painted<a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/politics-policy/biden-trump-offer-distinct-healthcare-agendas-leave-some-questions-unanswered"> different healthcare visions</a> for the country. Biden has promised to strengthen the Affordable Care Act by increasing subsidies and incentivizing Medicaid expansion, while adding a public insurance option on the exchanges. Trump, on the other hand, supports a <a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/legal/supreme-court-will-hear-challenge-affordable-care-act">lawsuit to strike down the Affordable Care Act</a> and has instead focused on regulatory measures like <a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/law-regulation/trump-price-transparency-proposals-take-long-bet-curbing-costs">increasing price transparency</a> and <a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/insurance/appeals-court-upholds-trumps-short-term-plan-expansion">expanding cheaper alternatives to exchange plans</a>. The candidates have also sparred over Trumpâ€™s <a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/politics-policy/trump-biden-trade-barbs-final-debate-healthcare-plans-medicare">handling of the COVID-19 crisis</a>.&nbsp;</p>
