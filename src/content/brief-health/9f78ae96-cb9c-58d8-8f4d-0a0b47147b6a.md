<p>Diagnostics giant Labcorp is stepping deeper into the digital health space with the launch of Labcorp OnDemand, an online platform where users can order tests and possibly collect samples at home.
Labcorp is pitching the platform as a more convenient way for patients to access blood tests, as well as an expansion of their digital health offerings.
The OnDemand platform is an intuitive experience where individuals can purchase tests online and choose from multiple options to take the test, including in the comfort of their own home," Amy Summy, Labcorp’s executive vice president and chief marketing officer, said in a statement.</p>
