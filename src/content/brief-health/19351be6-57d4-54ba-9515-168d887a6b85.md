<p>Sprinter Health, a California-based company, and Firefly Health have established a partnership to include Sprinter's home clinical services into Firefly's virtual primary care. Through Sprinter's phlebotomists and nurses, Firefly members will be able to receive lab draws, vital signs checks, electrocardiograms, diabetic eye exams, and food screenings at home. The lab findings and remarks will be sent to Firefly doctors electronically for review. Patients with Firefly in the Boston region will be the first to receive the update. Max Cohen, CEO and cofounder of Sprinter Health, stated in a statement, "Together with Firefly Health, we are helping to reduce the time it takes to gather essential data that a physician requires into just minutes of a patient's time. The conclusion is that high-touch, in-person services are required along with the convenience and cost of telemedicine.</p>
