    <p>The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) turns 75 today. &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The NHS was the brainchild of Minister of Health
    Aneurin Bevan; he wrote in a statement to doctors and nurses in The Lancet
    on July 3, 1948,&nbsp; “My job is to give you all the facilities, resources,
    apparatus and help I can, and then to leave you alone as professional men
    and women to use your skill and judgement without hindrance.” This week in
    The Lancet, the editors assert, “The founding principles of the NHS put into
    practice 75 years ago are at risk of being compromised.” Like any 75th
    birthday, there is a lot to unpack — pain points and acute issues, stresses
    and a lot to reflect on during this long life of what has turned out to be
    one of the most beloved institutions in the United Kingdom. &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>With a focus on people, the blog Healthpopuli explores the complexities of the health and care ecosystem. Author Jane Sarasohn-Kahn recently wrote an article titled "Happy 75th Birthday, NHS - Through A U.S. Health Care Lens," in which she analyses the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom from the standpoint of American health care. The article examines a variety of subjects, including design and health, social determinants of health, public health, social security, European health care, health citizenship, health consumers, health costs, health economics, health equity, health finance, health insurance, health policy, and virtual health. It offers perceptive analyses and thoughts on the NHS and its effects in relation to other health care systems.</p>
