title: 'Ransomware and medical devices: How behavior analytics can protect patients'
---

Medical devices must be managed from a security perspective, but also from an operational perspective. Using analytics to establish behavior baselines helps support risk assessments, find malfunctions and enhance staff productivity. From a cybersecurity perspective, I believe the healthcare industry is in a growing medical device crisis. The emerging trend of ransomware attacks on medical devices has created serious vulnerabilities in healthcare security.

Ransomware threats, and their implications for medical devices, center around the wide adoption of easily compromised operating systems on these devices, creating a growing vulnerability with potentially life-threatening ramifications. And what many people may not know is that ransomware attacks on medical devices have already occurred.
