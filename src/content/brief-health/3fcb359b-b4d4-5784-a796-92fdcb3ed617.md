<p>This tool provides guidance to states to improve integration of state Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) with clinicians’ health IT systems.
Integrating PDMP data into EHR systems addresses barriers to accessing and using PDMP data to help inform clinical practice to improve opioid prescribing.
MOU Guidance [PDF – 423KB]: provides key topics and points for consideration in developing PDMP-EHR data integration and sharing agreements. To help inform the development of the Integration Framework, the ONC and CDC project team partnered with eight health systems across five states.
If you are preparing to integrate your health IT systems with your state’s PDMP and interested in electronic CDS tools, or if you are a state PDMP administrator, explore the Integration Framework for helpful guidance on successful PDMP and CDS integrations.</p>
