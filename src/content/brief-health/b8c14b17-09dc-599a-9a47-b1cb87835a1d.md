<p>The research institute claims to have processed the largest genome data set in Australia to date.<br><br>As one of the top surgery centers in the nation per Newsweek for both 2021 and 2022, The Surgical Center at Columbia Orthopaedic Group felt it was representative of its quality and reputation to create a system that improved the care it offered patients.
To help meet this goal, the ambulatory surgery center contracted with health IT vendor Force Therapeutics, which offers a digital care management platform that leverages clinical data and custom protocols to educate patients and monitor their progress throughout an episode of care.
"The platform was designed to supplement our standard pain-scale reporting with questions about recent levels of activity, or how well the patient is following their medication regimen," he continued.
The platform alerts the patient's care team when needed, prompting clinicians to check in with the patient about mobility issues, pain management or other concerns.
"Instead of randomly searching online for medical information about their surgery, patients can trust the Force platform, as they know this information is clinically validated and approved by their surgeon," he continued.
"Patients also can message their care teams through the platform to confirm information or clarify a postoperative symptom they're experiencing."
About two years ago, The Surgical Center at Columbia Orthopaedic Group launched the Force Therapeutics care management platform to connect patients to their care teams throughout their recovery process.
"The platform helps patients really remember and internalize instructions, because it offers short, digestible videos at the best time in the process, which is right before the patient needs to know that particular piece of information," he continued.
"Demographic data is imported from Emme into the Force platform to inform The Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Sydney has teamed up with Google Cloud to process a data set of about 14,000 genomes to drive early diagnosis of rare genetic disorders.</p>
