<p>LAS VEGAS, Nev.—They came for the vaccine mandate and they stayed for the face-to-face (albeit masked) networking.</p><p>About 19,300 people attended the 2021 Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Global Conference in Las Vegas, according to an&nbsp;estimate late Thursday from the conference host, HIMSS.&nbsp;About 5,000 people logged on&nbsp;for the digital program. The conference typically draws around 40,000 people annually, HIMSS reports. There were roughly 700 exhibiting companies this year, also about half the typical volume.</p><p>HIMSS21 served as a test case for the healthcare and events industries, as the&nbsp;first and largest healthcare conference to hold an in-person event in the past 18 months since the COVID-19 pandemic began.</p>
