<p>I'm interviewed by Adam Sewell at the Medical Entrepreneur podcast. I share insights on the non-linear paths physicians can take with their degrees and their options beyond clinical medicine. I'm not behind the microphone in this episode. Adam Sewell does an interview with me for the Medical Entrepreneur podcast. I offer perspectives on the non-linear career routes that doctors can pursue with their degrees and the choices available to them outside of clinical practise. We also discuss physician burnout and the high prevalence of suicide in the medical field. I stress the value of having a diverse income and being financially independent in order to prevent burnout. We place a strong emphasis on the necessity of paying off debts and having a second source of income in order to have more freedom to pursue interests outside of clinical practise. Join us for this stimulating discussion about the state of medicine and the options open to doctors.</p>
