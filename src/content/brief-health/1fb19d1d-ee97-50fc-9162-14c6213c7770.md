<p>Researchers found a 169% year-over-year increase in global telehealth investment, with the top five deals alone worth $1.5 billion.<br><br>A new report from CB Insights found that global telehealth investment rose for the fourth consecutive quarter in Q2 of 2021 – with teletherapy deals representing a substantial share. &nbsp;</p><p>The <i>State Of Telehealth</i> <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/telehealth-trends-q2-2021/">report</a> found that much of the growth was pushed by accelerating digital transformation initiatives, as well as patient experience prioritization.</p><p>At the same time, stakeholders and thought leaders voiced concerns about health inequity, and lobbyists mounted the pressure for long-term regulatory reform. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong></p><p>The telehealth train has continued to chug along, despite dire warnings from health advocates about <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/telehealth-cliff-looms-hundreds-healthcare-orgs-urge-congress-act">what might happen</a> if the public health emergency expires without any action from Congress. &nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, the CB Insights report was optimistic from a financial perspective: It found that global telehealth investment grew 17% quarter-over-quarter compared to Q1 of 2021,&nbsp;and 169% year-over-year, to reach a record high of $5 billion across 163 deals. &nbsp;</p><p>As far as segments go, telemedicine providers, platforms and marketplaces saw their first decline in six quarters, with mergers and acquisitions at a record high.</p><p>Meanwhile, teletherapy – especially with regard to mental health and chronic diseases – was an investor hotspot, and virtual care enablement companies saw a funding high. &nbsp;</p>
