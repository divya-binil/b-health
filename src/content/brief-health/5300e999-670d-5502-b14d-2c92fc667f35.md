title: Top 10 Medical resources for patients
---

There are over 1 billion health-related searches on Google every single day, according to a report. This was about 7% of all searches on the platform before, and no one will be surprised when the 2020 data massively surpasses this number. After all, the internet is likely the first source to turn to with your health-related questions.

But which hits are relevant, and which lead to straightforward la la land – even with the best intentions and the best A.I. toolset, the search giant can’t exclude the latter from among the results. And yet, doing so is especially important in the case of medicine and healthcare, since the well-being of people is at stake. As technological development empowers patients, they are taking care of their health in a more active way. There is already a myriad of online resources and it’s a challenge on how to choose the best for the specific individual needs.

Among the many amazing sources out there, here are my top 10 choices when it comes to finding reliable medical and health information online. From medical websites to online toolkits, these are the favourites that I can always trust and rely on – and you should do so, too.
