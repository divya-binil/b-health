<p>Smart stethoscope company Eko received a $2.7 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, and Halo raised $2.6 million for its research and development collaboration tool.
Smart stethoscope company Eko received a $2.7 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to develop a machine learning algorithm that detects and classifies pulmonary hypertension. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Direct Phase II grant will go toward an algorithm that uses phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) data collected by Eko's stethoscopes to find pulmonary hypertension, or high blood pressure, that affects arteries in the lungs and the right side of heart.
Halo, which offers a platform that aims to connect companies and scientists for research and development, raised $2.6 million in seed funding.
Through our platform, we engineer serendipity so companies can quickly and easily scout for new technologies, expand their networks globally and build relationships with scientists year round."</p>
