<p>Soon, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-personal-health-by-introducing-secure-sharing-and-new-insights/">announced</a> recently, it will enable doctors to monitor health data from their patients’ phones and watches between visits, part of the push into health care that Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/tim-cook-teases-new-apple-services-tied-to-health-care.html">declared</a> will constitute the company’s greatest contribution to mankind.</p><p>Over 100 types of data are available in Apple’s health app through iPhone, Apple Watch and third-party apps. In June, Apple said patients whose doctors work with one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TD96VTf0Xs&amp;t=3899s">six electronic medical record companies</a> participating in the new feature will be able to send them tracked data like <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-personal-health-by-introducing-secure-sharing-and-new-insights/">heart rate, sleep hours, exercise minutes</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/health/">steps, falls or menstrual cycle history</a>.</p><p>Some see great promise in building “pipes” between a patient’s phone and the health records viewed by their clinicians. Apple is “democratizing the flow of health data” between doctors and patients, said Anil Sethi, a former Apple health director and current CEO of <a href="https://www.ciitizen.com/">Ciitizen</a>, a startup that manages health data for cancer patients.</p>
