<p>With real-world data from its Learning Health Network, Cerner hopes to advance oncology innovation and expand access to clinical trials.<br><br>Cerner this week announced that it is collaborating with Elligo Health Research and Freenome for a clinical trial project that seeks to advance early cancer detection via insights derived from Cerner's Learning Health Network.</p><p><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong><br>The three companies will be harness real-world data from the network's participating health system and use Freenome's "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7003173/">multiomics</a>" technology for the Sanderson Study, an forthcoming clinical trial designed to detect multiple types of cancer.</p><p>Freenome’s platform uses machine learning models to analyze tumor and non-tumor signals, with the goal of detecting cancer in its earliest, most treatable stages with a single blood draw. The aim is to innovate a more patient-centric approach to multi-cancer detection, reducing diagnostic complexity and optimizing processes for clinical efficiency.</p>
