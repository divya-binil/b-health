<p>Christopher Lis, managing director of global healthcare intelligence at J.D. Power, discusses the recent primary care deals by Amazon and CVS Health. Two significant retail and pharmaceutical firms made significant moves in healthcare delivery last month: CVS Health announced plans to acquire Oak Street Health, while Amazon completed its acquisition of One Medical. According to Christopher Lis, managing director of global healthcare intelligence at J.D. Power, the agreements are not shocking. A significant demographic for primary care clinicians is the fact that more than 31 million people are already enrolled in Medicare Advantage programmes. Meanwhile, providing care closer to or inside the house may reduce costs and boost quality of life. Lis sat down with MobiHealthNews to talk about the latest M&amp;A deals and potential plans for care delivery that stores and pharmacies may have. Similar developments in healthcare delivery are being made by other businesses including Walgreens and Walmart.&nbsp;</p>
