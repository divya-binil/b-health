<p>A new report from the password manager vendor 1Password found that employee burnout presents a "severe, pervasive and multifaceted security risk." &nbsp;
Workers in virtually every industry are reporting high levels of burnout, said researchers – potentially leading employees to let their guard down around security threats.
Alarmingly, security professionals are reporting even higher rates of burnout – and nearly a third say they're looking for new jobs or are about to quit.
"Security professionals were more likely than other types of workers to say they work around their company’s policies because they are trying to solve their own IT problems themselves … or because they hate the software their company provides," noted report authors.</p>
