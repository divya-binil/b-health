<p>Zócalo Health, a virtual healthcare service for Latino patients, raised $5 million in a seed funding round led by Animo, Virtue and Vamos Ventures.
Zócalo will use the seed capital to launch virtual primary care services in California, Texas and Washington this year.
Zócalo CEO Cardenas said the community health workers will be key to establishing trust and helping patients navigate their clinical offerings.
"With this community health worker, we really focus on those relationships and building trust so that people can really start to engage and establish this longitudinal care with us that they've been missing with this one-size-fits-all health system," he said.</p>
