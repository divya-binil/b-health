<p>The National Academy of Medicine says having a primary care doc is key. A physician expert in telehealth explains technology's role in fulfilling this need.<br><br>The <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2021/05/high-quality-primary-care-should-be-available-to-every-individual-in-the-u-s-says-new-report-payment-reform-telehealth-expansion-state-and-federal-policy-changes-recommended">National Academy of Medicine recently released a report</a> urging everyone to have a primary care physician. The report went on to recommend that telehealth could have a role to play in this expansion of primary care.</p><p>Dr. Josh Emdur is chief medical officer at SteadyMD, a virtual primary care provider that also powers telehealth for digital health companies and employers. He is in an excellent position to comment on the report and the potential here for telemedicine, so <i>Healthcare IT News</i> interviewed him to get his perspective on the issue.</p>
