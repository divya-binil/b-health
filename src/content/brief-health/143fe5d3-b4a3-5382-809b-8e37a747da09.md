<p>Report card seeks to help healthcare organizations identify and address discriminatory behaviors and bias in care delivery. A new Health Equity Report Card pilot programme has been created by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), a nonprofit association of cancer clinics in the United States. The Elevating Cancer Equity initiative was launched in 2020 by NCCN, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN), and the National Minority Quality Forum (NMQF), with a working group led by Shonta Chambers, M.S.W., executive vice president of health equity and community engagement at the Patient Advocate Foundation, and Robert A. Winn, M.D., director of the Virginia Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center. In order to help healthcare organisations and providers recognise and address bias and discriminatory attitudes in the delivery of care, address socioeconomic determinants of health, and overcome these issues, that group created the HERC in early 2021.</p>
