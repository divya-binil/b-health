<p>Priorities include health equity, enhancing infrastructure to accelerate patient-centered outcomes research<br><br>The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) board of governors has adopted five National Priorities for Health, which serve as long-term goals to guide PCORI’s funding of patient-centered comparative clinical effectiveness research (CER) and other engagement, dissemination and implementation, and research infrastructure initiatives.
• Accelerate Progress Toward an Integrated Learning Health System: The goal is to foster actionable, timely, place-based, and transformative improvements in patient-centered experiences, care provision, and ultimately improved health outcomes through collaborative, multisectoral research to support a health system that understands and serves the needs and preferences of individuals.<br>&nbsp;</p>
