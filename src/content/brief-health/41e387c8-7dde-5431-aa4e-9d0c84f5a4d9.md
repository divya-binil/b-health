<p>Mental health care is crucial for a healthy society, but it remains underrated and under-resourced, with many individuals lacking access to treatment and facing stigma, necessitating urgent action to improve awareness and solutions worldwide. One of the most underappreciated areas of healthcare, in my opinion, is mental health treatment. The epidemic of mental disease affects almost every country in the world. While significant progress has been achieved in the detection and treatment of mental illnesses, particularly in developed nations, many people still lack access to adequate care. The figures are astounding. Over 1 billion people worldwide suffer from mental diseases, yet in low-income countries, at least 75% of them do not receive treatment, according to the World Health Organization 2020 study. This pervasive problem is made worse by a lack of resources, the stigma associated with receiving a mental health diagnosis, and inadequate information about the therapies that are available. The moment has come to raise awareness of this situation and take action.</p>
