<p>Becker's spoke to a number of hospital and health system CIOs across the U.S. to discuss how their role is changing and what issues, technology and trends they are watching out for in the second half of the year. Although no single organization can fend-off every attack, CIOs are shoring up their resources to help prevent or stop them before protected health information is exposed or systems are taken down.
CIOs see the healthcare sector investing in more innovative new technology as a growing number of health systems further their advancement in software, sensors and other technologies that can enhance care delivery.</p>
