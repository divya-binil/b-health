<p>HOBOKEN, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Semperis, a pioneer of identity-driven cyber resilience for enterprises, today announced the addition of Todd Greene, Vice President &amp; Enterprise CISO at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Atrium Health, to its Strategic Advisory Board.
Atrium Health participated in Semperis' recent Series C funding round of more than $200 million, led by KKR.
In his advisory role, Todd will guide Semperis’ healthcare-specific initiatives and be a strategic resource for customers, including the world’s largest health systems.
“Cutting-edge innovation is in Atrium Health’s DNA, and I admire Todd’s long track record of cybersecurity leadership – especially in the areas of threat exchange and research, disaster recovery and customer advocacy.”
</p><p>Semperis is widely adopted in the healthcare sector, with a focus on protecting critical and persistently targeted identity systems, like Active Directory and Azure AD.
Over time, he has been part of the organization’s growth into an integrated, multi-state health provider that now includes Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist, also in North Carolina, and Atrium Health Navicent and Atrium Health Floyd in Georgia.
“Cutting-edge innovation is in Atrium Health’s DNA, and I admire Todd’s long track record of cybersecurity leadership – especially in the areas of threat exchange and research, disaster recovery and customer advocacy."
Purpose-built for securing hybrid Active Directory environments, Semperis’ patented technology protects over 50 million identities from cyberattacks, data breaches and operational errors.
Semperis hosts the award-winning Hybrid Identity Protection conference and podcast series (www.hipconf.com) and built the community hybrid Active Directory cyber defender tools, Purple Knight (www.purple-knight.com) and Forest Druid.</p>
