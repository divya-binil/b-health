<p>The future of policy around telemedicine and maternal care is discussed by Mayealie Adams, managing director of government and external affairs at Philips. The nation's plight was highlighted this past week when Vice President Kamala Harris declared the first-ever federal Day of Action on Maternal Health. In the United States, more women die from childbirth-related reasons than in any other developed country, according to Harris, and the risk is significantly higher for women of color, particularly Black women. Harris proposed a number of solutions to this problem, including the start of a new campaign to create birthing-friendly institutions and collaborations with nonprofits and for-profit businesses to fund cutting-edge care models. &nbsp;</p>
