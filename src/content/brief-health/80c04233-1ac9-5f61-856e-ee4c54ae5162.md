<p>The potential of AIRS Medical's AI MRI reconstruction tool to denoise and enhance the quality of 3D MR images has also been demonstrated. Taiwan's Food and Drug Administration has given South Korean company VUNO permission to market its AI fundus analysis software. To swiftly locate lesions suggestive of retinal disorders such diabetic retinopathy, macular disease, and glaucoma, VUNO Med-Fundus AI analyses images of the fundus. Following Taiwan FDA approval for two previous AI products, VUNO-Med Chest X-ray and VUNO-Med Bone Age, comes this most recent accreditation. VUNO only received Singapore's approval for VUNO Med-Fundus AI two months ago. A study supports AIRS Medical's use of artificial intelligence to denoise 3D MR pictures.</p>
