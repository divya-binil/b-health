<p>A 22-site Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), CommuniCare, has switched to the eClinicalWorks EHR and additional services to improve operational workflows and offer value-based care to more than 95,000 patients in the San Antonio, Texas, area, according to eClinicalWorks速, a leader in health care IT solutions. "With CommuniCare, we're attempting to do that. CommuniCare's doctors and staff can concentrate more on delivering value-based care to individuals in south-central Texas who need it most by utilising an EHR that combines with patient engagement features, coding, billing, and other tasks. CommuniCare required a new health IT system that combined front-office, back-office, and patient-treatment elements to better service its expanding patient population, which is mostly made up of Medicare, Medicaid, and uninsured individuals.&nbsp;</p>
