<p>It’s in the nature of presidential candidates and new presidents to promise big things. Just months after his 1961 inauguration, President John F. Kennedy&nbsp;<a href="https://history.nasa.gov/moondec.html"><strong>vowed</strong></a>&nbsp;to send a man to the moon by the end of the decade. That pledge was kept,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/jun/26/broken-presidential-campaign-promises-1916/"><strong>but many others haven’t been</strong></a>, such as candidate Bill Clinton’s promise to provide universal healthcare and presidential hopeful George H.W. Bush’s guarantee of no new taxes.</p><p>Now, during a once-in-a-century pandemic, incoming President Joe Biden has promised to provide 100 million COVID-19 vaccinations in his first 100 days in office.</p><p>“This team will help get … at least 100 million COVID vaccine shots into the arms of the American people in the first 100 days,” Biden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-announces-fauci-key-health-team-picks-briefing-transcript-december-8"><strong>said</strong></a>&nbsp;during a Dec. 8 news conference introducing key members of his health team.</p><p>When first asked about his pledge, the Biden team said the president-elect meant 50 million people would get their two-dose regimen. The incoming administration has since updated this plan, saying it will release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/politics/biden-vaccine-strategy/index.html"><strong>vaccine doses as soon as they’re available</strong></a>&nbsp;instead of holding back some of that supply for second doses.</p><p>Either way, Biden may run into difficulty meeting that 100 million mark.</p>
