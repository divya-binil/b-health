<p>An upcoming HIMSS21 Global Conference Digital session will put the focus on how RNs and NPs are changing the way their organizations operate for the better.<br><br>As more than half of the healthcare workforce, nurses are indispensable to effective care delivery. But too often they're hamstrung with suboptimal equipment, <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/nurses-give-ehr-usability-f-new-study">burdensome processes</a> and inefficient workflows.</p><p>And that's under normal circumstances. After the chaos and stress of the past year and a half, many nurses are <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/pandemic-era-burnout-nurses-trenches-say-technology-hurts-and-helps">burnt out and exhausted</a> – and some estimates predict that half a million of them will leave the workforce by next year.</p><p>In an upcoming HIMSS21 Digital session, nursing leaders will discuss ways these critical frontline workers can be empowered to do their jobs better, and innovate new approaches and strategies that fit their needs.</p><p>The presentation, <a href="https://www.himss.org/global-conference/session-visionary-keynote-nursing-innovators-driving-force-health-care-reform">Nursing Innovators: A Driving Force in Health Care Reform</a>, will explore how these nurses – these "MacGyvers of the supply closet," who routinely improvise dozens of more efficient tech workarounds and workflow fixes in the course of their 12-hour shifts – are being given the tools they need and support they deserve in inpatient, outpatient and at-home settings.</p>
