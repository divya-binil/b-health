<p>The Innovator’s Canvas 3 can help you understand how to prepare and deploy various business models much more quickly and cost effectively. The canvas can be helpful in working with vendors and partners, both so they can understand your model a little better and you can understand theirs. It should also be a great tool for helping organize business model validation work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
