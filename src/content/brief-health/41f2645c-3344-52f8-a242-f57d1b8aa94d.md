<p>Healthcare is evolving at a rapid pace. We've put together a list of books to help leaders face the changing times and transform healthcare for the better.<br><br>While change is not new, leaders agree that healthcare is transforming at an ever-increasing rate thanks to the speed of information, digitization, organizational change and behavior, as well as government, patient safety and quality, financial and socio-economic pressures.

The shift from traditional to intelligent systems in order to improve clinical, operational and financial performance is a key strategic consideration in the transformation of healthcare as we know it.</p>
