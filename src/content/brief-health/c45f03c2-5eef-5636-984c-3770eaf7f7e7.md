<p>Despite investor fears of a telehealth slowdown, the market banked a record-setting&nbsp;$5 billion in 163 funding deals in the second quarter of 2021.</p><p>Global telehealth investment rose for the fourth consecutive quarter, growing 17% quarter over quarter and 169% year over year, according to a new <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/telehealth-trends-q2-2021/"><strong>report</strong></a> from market intelligence company CB Insights.</p><p>The nascent telehealth space is beginning to show signs of maturity, as, so far in 2021, early-stage deals are&nbsp;tracking at a historical low while&nbsp;late-stage deal share is at a high, the report said.</p><p>In the second quarter, the top five&nbsp;deals alone were worth $1.6 billion, representing 30% of quarterly funding. &nbsp;</p><p>At the top of the list, Noom, an app that helps people lose&nbsp;weight by focusing on behavior change, bulked&nbsp;up with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/digital-health/weight-loss-app-noom-hauls-540m-to-expand-into-diabetes-hypertension"><strong>$540 million in a series F funding round</strong></a> led by new investor Silver Lake. Other new investors&nbsp;participated&nbsp;in the round including&nbsp;Oak HC/FT, Temasek and Novo Holdings. Existing investors Sequoia Capital, RRE and Samsung Ventures also participated.</p><p>The digital health company saw rapid growth in 2020 as people looked to shed&nbsp;pandemic-fueled pounds, and it's now looking to expand beyond weight loss to areas such as stress and anxiety, diabetes, hypertension&nbsp;and sleep.&nbsp;</p>
