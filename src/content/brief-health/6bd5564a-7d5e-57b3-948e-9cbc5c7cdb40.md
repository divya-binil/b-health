<p>Connected-device intelligence is critical on high-volume hospital networks. Jeffrey Vinson, CISO of Harris Health System, and Jim Hyman, CEO of Ordr, explain the value of situational awareness for IoMT security. To ensure the safety of medical devices from ransomware attacks, the following steps can be taken:</p><ul><li>Regular software updates: Regularly updating the software on medical devices is crucial in fixing vulnerabilities and patching any known security issues.</li><li>Network segregation: Segregating medical devices from other IT systems in a separate network reduces the risk of infection from other devices.</li><li>Access control: Implementing strict access controls to medical devices can prevent unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information or altering device settings.</li><li>Data backup: Regularly backing up important data and keeping backups in a separate location can help recover from a ransomware attack without paying the ransom.</li><li>Antivirus and anti-malware software: Installing antivirus and anti-malware software on medical devices can help detect and prevent the spread of ransomware.</li><li>Security training: Regular security training for staff on identifying and avoiding phishing attacks and other social engineering tactics can help reduce the risk of a successful ransomware attack.</li><li>Conduct penetration testing: Regularly testing the security of medical devices through penetration testing can help identify vulnerabilities and improve overall security.</li></ul><p>It is important to keep in mind that no system is 100% secure and that a multi-layered approach to security can provide a higher level of protection against ransomware attacks.</p>
