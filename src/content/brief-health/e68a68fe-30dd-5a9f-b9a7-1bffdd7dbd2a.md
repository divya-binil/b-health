<p>Staffing and workforce management have long been one of the most difficult responsibilities borne by healthcare executives, specifically those with responsibility for revenue cycle operations.
A recent survey commissioned by AKASA and conducted by the Healthcare Financial Management Association’s (HFMA) Pulse Survey program found that “75% of organizations intend to significantly restructure their revenue cycle operations in response to shifting business dynamics driven by the pandemic.”
For revenue cycle leaders, managing a largely remote workforce has raised several challenges.
While it may seem overwhelming for some hospital leaders who have long abided by the traditional approach to workforce management, but the pandemic has created opportunities to leverage technology to help staff work smarter and more efficiently.
From a technology perspective, workforce performance management is about how an organization can use data to assess how well it’s performing as a management team in three key areas: productivity, process, and engagement.
Consistently measuring and evaluating productivity is the first key for organizations that have a remote workforce.
While technology can’t turn back the clock to the days prior to COVID-19 for revenue cycle operations, organizations can use digital tools to replicate what happened in hallways and staff meetings.
Having a digital ecosystem that keeps people connected to the mission, supports overall productivity, makes process performance easier to measure, and promotes engagement is how leaders can keep their remote workforce on task without being overbearing.</p>
