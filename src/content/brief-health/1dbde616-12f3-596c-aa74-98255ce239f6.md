<p>Hospital executives were given a cost-benefit analysis of error avoidance with an estimated savings of $6 million a year.<br><br>Artificial intelligence has stepped in to help complete the medication information in the medical record for patients who can't remember what drugs they are taking, let alone the dose.&nbsp;</p><p>This is most of us, according to Rebecca Sulfridge, a clinical pharmacist and emergency specialist at Covenant HealthCare in Michigan. Most patients have gaps in their medication history.&nbsp;</p><p>Technicians hear, "'I take three pills.&nbsp;One is a little white one.&nbsp;One is a pink one,'" or "'I know I take two blood pressure meds and one to sleep at night,'" in face-to-face talks with patients, according to Sulfridge. Even those patients who know the convoluted names of all the drugs they're taking may not know the dose.</p><p>It's Sulfridge's job to reconcile the medication medical record in the emergency room.</p><p>"The heart and soul lies with the medical history," Sulfridge said.</p><p>Improvements have been made through artificial intelligence embedded in the health system's electronic health record.</p>
