<p>The largest nonprofit patient safety group in the country, ECRI, examined race-related patient safety reports and found that both patients and healthcare providers routinely encounter offensive remarks regarding race. Reviewing more than 500 racial patient safety incidents, it was discovered that 57% of these involved patients saying or doing anything racist. 42% of reported occurrences involved workers who perpetrated racist acts. According to Marcus Schabacker, MD, PhD, president and CEO of ECRI, "As health institutions implement diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, the needs of providers of colour must be taken into account, as well as those of patients." Recognizing and responding to racist acts is essential to fostering an equitable and secure environment.</p>
