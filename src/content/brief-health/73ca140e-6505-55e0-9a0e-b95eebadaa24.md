<p>More hospitals, which already had stricter ventilation requirements than typical office buildings, are investing in air quality solutions due to COVID-19, Charlotte Business Journal reported Nov. 5.
Many hospitals have built temporary spaces to handle an influx of COVID patients, like Atrium Health, also in Charlotte, which used drive-thru testing and tents outside of emergency departments, according to Charlotte Business Journal.
This includes Marianna, Fla.-based Jackson Hospital, which is seeking a grant to change its third floor into a pandemic wing.
With these sudden changes, hospitals are having to pay higher costs, Charlotte Business Journal reported.</p>
