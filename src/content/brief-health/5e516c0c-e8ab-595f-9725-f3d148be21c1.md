<p>The Biden administration is proposing to increase the penalty for hospitals that don't comply with a federal rule requiring them to publicly post the prices of their procedures.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/07/19/cms-proposes-role-to-increase-price-transparency-access-to-care-health-equity.html">proposal released Monday</a> by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would raise the maximum penalty to $2 million a year for large hospitals that don't post online the secret prices they have negotiated with insurance companies for 300 common services and procedures that can be planned in advance.&nbsp;</p><p>The proposal represents a sharp increase from the current maximum penalty of only $109,500 a year for large hospitals, which are those with more than 30 beds.&nbsp;</p>
