<p>Refining large language models is where the rubber meets the road for artificial intelligence such as GPT, says Manny Krakaris, CEO of Augmedix. "You don't want the model to extrapolate." Regulators want to control artificial intelligence, while employees adore ChatGPT. The junction of push and pull in this case of GPT is healthcare. Additionally, there will be a lot of GPT pull at HIMSS23 next week, just like at other health technology conferences. According to Manny Krakaris, CEO of Augmedix, massive language models are in the company's DNA. Augmedix provides automated medical documentation and data services. As a result of concentrating on the issue of note bloat, Augmedix operates sophisticated LLMs in its Ambient Automation Platform, which is accessible to healthcare systems and providers. This week, we chatted with Krakaris about the fascination with OpenAI's GPT models and the need for AI in healthcare to assist physicians in streamlining procedures. Because OpenAI has made it simple to utilise ChatGPT, everyone is trying it out.</p>
