title: Mitigating the Risks Posed by Malicious Insiders

Healthcare organizations need to proactively mitigate the threats of malicious insiders, the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights reminds covered entities and business associates in a recent alert.

"Malicious insiders can succeed in harming an organization by intentionally leaking or destroying sensitive information," OCR, which enforces HIPAA, writes. "The harm can take various forms, including loss of data, damage to the organization's reputation, civil liability exposure, and potential federal and state regulatory enforcement actions. In addition to organizational harm, individuals affected by a data breach could be at risk for identity theft, fraud, or even blackmail."
