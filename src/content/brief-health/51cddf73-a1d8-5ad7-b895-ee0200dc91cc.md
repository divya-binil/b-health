<p><a href="https://www.virtualhealth.com/">VirtualHealth</a>, the industry-leading SaaS solution for comprehensive medical management, has been named a bronze winner in the ‘Most Innovative Product of the Year’ category at the 2021 Best in Biz Awards for its HELIOSvisit® telehealth solution. Best in Biz Awards is the only independent business awards program judged each year by prominent editors and reporters from top-tier publications in North America.</p><p>As the world navigates the healthcare system amid the current pandemic, telehealth solutions have become more vital than ever. HELIOSvisit allows care managers and clinicians to initiate HIPAA-compliant video calls, HIPAA-compliant chat, and HIPAA-compliant file exchange with anyone in their care. HELIOSvisit increases healthcare accessibility for patients without needing a specific software or program. The capability works on all devices with an internet browser through a hyperlink sent in a text message or email to seamlessly connect patients and healthcare providers for telehealth visits.</p><p>“We are honored to receive this recognition for HELIOSvisit,” said Adam Sabloff, CEO of VirtualHealth. “During a time when our healthcare industry is facing its greatest challenges, we strived to create a solution for care managers to more seamlessly interact with patients in a manner that kept everyone safe. We are proud to play a role in the ongoing innovation happening in the digital health sphere that is moving our industry forward.”</p><p>HELIOSvisit is the first solution to give care managers the power of a telehealth system that is fully integrated with the rest of their member data through HELIOS®, VirtualHealth’s leading SaaS care management platform. HELIOS ingests the most complete datasets from across the healthcare ecosystem – including clinical, behavioral and social data – and transforms these disparate feeds into centralized, actionable, and highly automated workflows for care managers. The platform leverages advanced robotic process automation (RPA) to streamline end-to-end processes, allowing care teams to spend more time with members and less time working through administrative overhead.</p><p>HELIOSvisit users gain the advantage of being one click away from directly and securely speaking to their patients. The solution comes complete with automated logging and documentation, easing administrative burdens on the care manager and empowering them to focus fully on the patient.</p><p>Best in Biz Awards is the only independent business awards program judged each year by prominent editors and reporters from top-tier publications in North America. This year’s Best in Biz Awards judges were impressed with the winning companies’ resilience and adaptability that allowed them to turn the challenges of the past 20 months into remarkable growth numbers, their exemplary dedication to their customers in matters small and large, and particularly, many winners’ efforts to maintain and deepen their commitment to the environment and local communities. The 2021 judging panel included, among others, writers from Associated Press, Barron’s, Consumer Affairs, Inc., USA Today and Wired.</p><p>To view the full list of winners in each category, visit: <a href="http://www.bestinbizawards.com/2021-winners">http://www.bestinbizawards.com/2021-winners</a>.</p><p>For more information on VirtualHealth’s HELIOS and HELIOSvisit capabilities, click <a href="https://www.virtualhealth.com/helios-platform">here</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
