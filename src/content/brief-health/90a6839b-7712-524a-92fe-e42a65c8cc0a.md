<p>The DoD's new cyber workforce strategy aims to address 30K unfilled cyber positions, and the agency is looking hard at "moving away from certifications," said Mark Gorak, cyber workforce policy and development integrator. Mark Gorak, principal director for resources and analysis for the Department of Defense's deputy chief information officer, spoke at TechNet Cyber 2023 in Baltimore about the Pentagon's severe shortage of cyber professionals and its intention to bring about a cultural change in hiring for cybersecurity and infosec roles. The Department of Defence is altering the way it has traditionally hired for the more than 30,000 cybersecurity and infosec positions. We've been working to solve this issue for about ten years, but it keeps getting worse, he claimed. The organisation is creating a plan for implementing a cyber workforce strategy that was unveiled last month. Gorak said on GovCIO's CyberCast at the Armed Forces Communications &amp; Electronics Association International's cyber conference that the plan has a five-year time frame and is due this summer.</p><p><a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/talent-over-certification-new-federal-cyber-workforce-plan">Read on healthcareitnews.com</a></p>
