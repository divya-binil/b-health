Last year, Cerner signed a record number with 39 new contracts in smaller community hospitals and systems. Eleven new facilities signed with <i>CommunityWorks</i>SM in the first three months of 2022. <i>CommunityWorks</i> is a scaled and tailored product that is uniquely positioned to provide rural communities and critical access hospitals with help to achieve their business goals, such as improved patient safety, efficiency and increased revenues.&nbsp;</p><p>“Our investment in Cerner will help us continue to deliver high-quality patient care and to remain one of the leading healthcare systems in our region,” said Vance Jackson, CEO of Davis Health System, located in West Virginia.&nbsp;“Through Cerner, we will consolidate multiple platforms into one EHR system.&nbsp;This will improve patient care, create efficiencies in cost and workflow and advance the technology used by our providers.”</p><p><strong>New Cerner</strong><i><strong> CommunityWorks</strong></i><strong> clients in the first quarter include:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.davishealthsystem.org/index">Davis Health System</a> (DHS) consists of three hospitals that serve the communities of Elkins, Phillipi and Webster Springs, WV. DHS was faced with the challenge of needing an EHR to support the ability to share information across facilities and the continuum of patient care.&nbsp;DHS chose to Cerner to help ensure a patient’s latest health information is available no matter which DHS facility or caregiver they visit.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="http://www.goodsamhospital.com/">Good Samaritan Hospital</a> (GSH), a 64-bed community hospital in Bakersfield, Calif., plans to consolidate multiple EHR systems into a single integrated approach with Cerner <i>CommunityWorks </i>as well as adopting Cerner’s clinically-driven revenue cycle. Serving the unique inpatient, ambulatory and behavioral health needs of their patient population, GSH is looking forward to joining the many other Cerner hospitals in their community as well as expanding the services they offer.</li><li><a href="https://www.mvmedcenter.org/">Madison Valley Medical Center</a> (MVMC), a 10-bed critical access hospital located in Ennis, Montana, decided to move to Cerner because of its ability to support and elevate their long-term business goals, such as remaining independent. MVMC was impressed with Cerner’s leadership in interoperability, which will give them the capability to connect to several referral partners in their region.</li><li><a href="https://www.mayersmemorial.com/">Mayers Memorial Healthcare District</a> (MMHD), a 16-bed critical access hospital in Fall River Mills, Calif., will consolidate its multiple EHR’s into one integrated platform with Cerner <i>CommunityWorks</i>. Their goal is to improve integration between facilities and remain autonomous instead of teaming with another area hospital to use their EHR. MMHD sees value in collaborating directly with Cerner and they welcome the opportunity to work with many other Cerner hospitals across the state.</li><li><a href="https://modocmedicalcenter.org/">Modoc Medical Center</a> (MMC), an 8-bed critical access hospital located in Alturas, Calif., chose Cerner because of the integrated user experience that can be easily accessed across the continuum of care. MMC is looking forward to implementing Cerner on a similar timeline as neighboring hospital, Mayers Memorial Healthcare District, to learn from one another, as well as getting the opportunity to work with many other Cerner hospitals across the state.</li><li><a href="https://www.willseye.org/">Wills Eye Hospital</a> (WEHP) is an eight-bed Ophthalmology specialty hospital located in Philadelphia, Penn., which has provided comprehensive ophthalmology care for patients since 1832 and has ranked consistently among the best ophthalmology hospitals in the U.S. They selected Cerner to provide one integrated patient record across the continuum of care and improve overall care coordination to enhance patient care. In addition, the switch to Cerner will enhance interoperability between its main affiliated hospital, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, and other health clinics to improve patient and clinician experience.</li></ul>
