<p>A product that plays music to help children brush their teeth for the right amount of time, is rightly part of the digital health technology space, alongside a product that checks heart rhythms for arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation. Both are great products and have value to offer, but beyond their common mode of delivery, they are poles apart.</p><p>As the uptake of digital health tech increases, so too does the need for robust digital health assessment methodology. National bodies looking to create a digital health standard or innovators looking to gather evidence both need clarity on this issue because so much rests on it.&nbsp;It’s these evaluations of impact which enable healthcare professionals and the public to make informed decisions about digital technologies.</p><p>The two key challenges are: what, in the first instance, constitutes suitable evidence, and then, how does this evidence fit into standards which vary widely across the globe?</p><p>When it comes to evidence, how can you tell which digital health technologies are safe, which will deliver improved outcomes, and in what scenarios?</p><p>Initially, there was no international reference point to help with this challenge. Traditional healthcare approaches to evidence, typically centre around randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or, more recently, high-quality observational studies capturing real world evidence. But digital health presents challenges to these traditional evidential approaches.&nbsp;</p>
