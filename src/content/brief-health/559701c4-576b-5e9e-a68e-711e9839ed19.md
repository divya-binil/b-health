<p>This past year has been a time of extraordinary challenges for healthcare workers and executives, and this is especially true for women in the industry.</p><p>Even before the pandemic, female physicians and researchers earned less, did more at home and were lower on the professional ladder compared to men. The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound and far-reaching impacts on healthcare workers in the U.S. This burden has, in many ways, been disproportionately shouldered by women.</p><p>Research from the British Medical Association and <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n658"><strong>published</strong></a> in the British Medical Journal found that female doctors have taken on extra—often unpaid—work during the pandemic, to the detriment of their own well-being and mental health.</p><p>There's also been a&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32538780/"><strong>notable decline</strong></a>&nbsp;in the amount of research submitted by women to academic journals compared to men.</p><p>In a survey by the Association of American Medical Colleges last year, 46% of female medical students voiced concern about the <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/939798"><strong>threat the pandemic poses to their careers</strong></a>, compared to only 36% of their male classmates.</p><p>But there are also significant shifts happening in the industry.&nbsp;Solving health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic&nbsp;demands the best minds the world has to offer, and women have played a critical role in the pandemic response. This past year has seen women in healthcare achieve spectacular accomplishments and demonstrate stellar leadership at every level of medicine.</p>
