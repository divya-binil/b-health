<p>On Oct. 12, the New York-headquartered McKinsey &amp; Company published an article entitled “<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/digital-health-ecosystems-voices-of-key-healthcare-leaders?cid=other-eml-dre-mip-mck&amp;hlkid=a774e1a8976d4a078406df70a8406fd5&amp;hctky=13077887&amp;hdpid=e3aa419e-7b14-4a47-9f73-236795511418">Digital health ecosystems: Voices of key healthcare leaders</a>.”</p><p>The article states that “Amid the disruption of traditional medical care caused by COVID-19, some patients have found assistance via new online services, including digital bill submission, medical assistance, online teleconsultations, and online medications. Perhaps for the first time, these patients found themselves part of digital health ecosystems, which are networks of digital service providers that offer a single solution for users’ healthcare needs.”</p><p>That said, “This article analyzes data from an interview series with 22 key international industry experts, as well as with 81 participants of our ninth Digital Healthcare Roundtable, to explore the following three themes: why and when healthcare players seek to provide digital healthcare solutions, what kind of digital health ecosystem healthcare players should provide, and how the implementation of a digital health ecosystem should be approached.”</p>
