If the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes or approves a COVID-19 vaccine, ACIP will quickly hold a public meeting to review all available data about that vaccine (sign up to receive email updates whenever ACIPâ€™s Meeting Information is updated). From these data, ACIP will then vote on whether to recommend the vaccine and, if so, who should receive it.
