<p>Since the start of vaccinations across the world, there have been some reports of allergic reactions to both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. However, a team of experts at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) have offered reassurance that both vaccines are safe and can be administered even to people with food or medication allergies. Their review is published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice.</p><p>Some people in the U.K. reported allergic reactions following the COVID-19 vaccination. In response, the country's medical regulatory agency advised that individuals who have a history of anaphylaxis to certain food items or medicines should avoid the vaccine. On the other hand, the FDA recommends that the vaccines should only be withheld in individuals who have a history of severe allergic reactions to any component of the vaccine. The CDC advises that patients should be observed for 15 minutes after vaccination to identify and manage any allergic reactions. But healthcare agencies in the U.S. are not recommending that people with food or medication allergies should avoid COVID-19 vaccination.</p>
