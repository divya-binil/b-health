Differentiating your innovation from competitors makes it more attractive and distinct   
  
Especially in today’s tech world, the word “innovation” gets a lot of lip service, and for good reason. Innovation drives growth, boosts profits, and slashes competition – not to mention the ability to change the world for the better. You would be hard-pressed to find a healthcare technology company that isn’t looking to push the envelope in some way.

There exist a virtually infinite amount of resources about how and why to innovate, overcoming barriers, and avoiding implementation issues. But where are the discussions about branding? Just as with any company’s offering, branding is often a critical element in the formula for success.
