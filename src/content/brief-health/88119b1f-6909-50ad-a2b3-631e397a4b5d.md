<p>Sharing real-time patient benefit and eligibility information with providers at the point of prescribing improves medication access and, ultimately, patient outcomes.<br><br>To help patients access their prescribed medications during office closures due to the pandemic, many health plans relaxed or waived medication regulations, such as prior authorization (PA) and refill-too-soon orders.</p><p>Despite this temporary relief, many patients still experienced delays getting their prescriptions filled.</p><p>Solutions such as real-time prescription benefit (RTPB), electronic prior authorization (ePA) and intelligent pharmacy workflows can help reduce administrative and benefit barriers contributing to these delays â€“ and improve medication adherence along the way.</p><p>RTPB technology enables providers, pharmacies, and payers to quickly exchange patient benefit coverage and out-of-pocket cost information. Relevant data can be surfaced within a single healthcare workflow that provides accurate data right from the source and can help more patients access their medications.</p><p>When providers used an RTPB solution, patients were 19 percent more adherent to picking up their medications.1</p>
