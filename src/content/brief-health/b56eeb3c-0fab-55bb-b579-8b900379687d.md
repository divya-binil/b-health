<p>World Hemophilia Day 2021, dedicated to creating international awareness of hemophilia and other inherited bleeding disorders, takes place on 17 April, the birthday of Frank Schnabel who founded the World Federation of Hemophilia. This year’s theme “Adapting to change: sustaining care in a new world” aims to raise awareness of issues related to proper care and advances in treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, people with bleeding disorders have had to contend with additional concerns regarding the possible effect vaccines may have on their health. In order to address these questions, the&nbsp;World Federation of Hemophilia published an article “<i>Vaccination against COVID-19: Rationale, modalities and precautions for patients with haemophilia and other inherited bleeding disorders” in the official journal. Various experts in the field&nbsp;–&nbsp;</i>on behalf of the WFH, the European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD), the European Haemophilia Consortium (EHC), and the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF)&nbsp;<i>–</i>&nbsp;contributed to the article.</p>
