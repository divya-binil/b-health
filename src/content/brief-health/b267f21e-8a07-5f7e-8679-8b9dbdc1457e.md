<p>Patients with an active patient portal are more likely to have shorter hospital stays, according to a new study based on data from electronic health record giant Epic.
Patients with active MyCharts had, on average, a stay half to a full day shorter than those without.
The difference was more dramatic among COVID-19 patients than those with heart failure; COVID patient stays were up to half a day shorter.
The largest reduction (just over a day) in the length of a stay was among COVID patients ages 65 to 74.</p>
