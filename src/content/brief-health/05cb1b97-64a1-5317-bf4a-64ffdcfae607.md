<p>Nurses and nurse informaticists of all levels, titles, years of experience and locations are encouraged to share their insights on the evolving role nurse informaticists play in healthcare. The survey aims to identify changing dynamics in clinical experience, job responsibilities, applications, barriers to success, compensation and benefits. The resulting report will demonstrate how nursing informatics has evolved into an integral part of healthcare delivery and a differentiating factor in the selection, implementation and evaluation of health IT that supports safe, high-quality, patient-centric care. Complete the Nursing Informatics Workforce Survey to help ascertain nursing informaticistsâ€™ role in digital healthcare.</p>
