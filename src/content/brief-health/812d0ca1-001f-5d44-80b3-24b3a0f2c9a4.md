<p>Healthcare interoperability issues have always been confusing, changing, and difficult to address. The reason why is not straightforward: we have a fragmented health system with a myriad of specialized applications that are not universally used. Instead, we have a system where each organization elects which technology tools to use and in what configuration.</p><p>Compounding this fragmented system is the push to <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/value-based-care/">value-based care (VBC)</a>. As more organizations shift their focus to VBC models, the need to have a cohesive view of patients is more critical than ever. Organizations – both payers and providers – engaged in VBC want to make sure that the most effective interventions are given to patients so that they save money.</p><p>With this in mind, it is critical that both payers and providers in VBC arrangements consider how their data flows through the entire system so that key partners, such as life sciences and pharmaceutical companies – have real-world insights (RWI) about the impact their medication is having on outcomes. Today, many large healthcare technology companies have done well in integrating data from disparate systems to build the Data Pipeline for their respective platforms but are still facing challenges to provide real-time access to Real World Data (RWD).&nbsp;</p>
