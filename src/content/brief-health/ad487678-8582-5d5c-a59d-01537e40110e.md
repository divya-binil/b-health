<p>In order to help operational choices, hc1, the pioneer in clinical insights, analytics, and solutions for precision health, today unveiled hc1 Sendout ManagementTM, a new solution that combines laboratory data. This solution offers real-time insight into reference lab performance and cost. With the help of hc1 Sendout Management's user-friendly dashboards, lab management can standardise their sendout process, make sure they are getting the best prices, and enforce accountability for performance benchmarks. These dashboards include key metrics like volume, total and average spend, and turnaround time. Customers of hc1 both new and old can take use of the solution, which can be used independently or as an addition to hc1 AnalyticsTM. Hospital and commercial labs spend a lot of money on sendout testing, but they frequently lack the real-time information required to make wise judgments, according to the statement.</p>
