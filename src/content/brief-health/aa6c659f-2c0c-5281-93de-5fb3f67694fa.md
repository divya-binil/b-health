<p>Throughout the years, we’ve reviewed several exciting digital health devices at The Medical Futurist. Some like <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/fighting-against-a-small-enemy-the-nima-peanut-sensor-review/">Nima’s handheld food sensors</a> sound as if they have come straight out of a Star Trek episode; and others like the <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/clinicloud-review-should-doctors-and-patients-use-the-digital-stethoscope/">CliniCloud</a> ingeniously address real physician needs.</p><p>However, while many of the devices impressed us during our tests and indicated a promising solution for patients and doctors to adopt going forward, not all of them fared so well in subsequent years. For this reason, we decided to look back at those exciting digital health devices that we tested in the past but didn’t deliver on the promise to become widely adopted.</p><p>In this retrospective article, we will revisit 5 such devices, highlight why they looked promising and what ultimately went wrong.</p>
