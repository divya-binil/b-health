<p>A hospital management information system created by the government is about to be adopted by the All India Institute Of Medical Science in New Delhi. The National Informatics Centre, the IT systems agency inside the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, built the e-hospital HMIS, and the predecessor AIIMS institute will begin deploying all of its components at the beginning of the next year. According to a press article, the deployment is a part of the hospital's move toward being paperless. This statement follows a NIC team's last week's hospital demonstration of the e-hospital modules. The patient registration, admission, discharge, and transfer, billing, clinic, LIS, RIS, pharmacy, OT management, dietary, and laundry modules are the current 10 modules of this cloud-based platform. Additionally, a working group and an oversight monitoring committee will be established.</p>
