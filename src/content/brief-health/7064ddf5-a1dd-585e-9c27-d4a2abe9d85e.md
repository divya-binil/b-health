<p>Our new paper, Forecasting Artificial Intelligence Trends in Health Care: Systematic International Patent Analysis, was just published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research AI (JMIR AI), and we are overjoyed to share this news. Our analysis examines over 10,000 healthcare AI patents from 2012 to 2022, taking an interesting deep dive into the field. With the help of our investigation, we were able to throw light on the development patterns, the direction that AI innovation is taking in terms of various medical specializations, and the potential future applications of AI and ML in the healthcare industry. In 2019â€“2020, we began our adventure into the area of healthcare AI innovation and regulation with some research that led to the publication of this report in Nature digital medicine.&nbsp;</p>
