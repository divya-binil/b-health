<p>If you’re among the thousands of medical students worldwide or are about to pursue a degree in healthcare, it might have dawned on you that the field wouldn’t look the same by the time you get into clinical practice. With <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/future-emergency-medicine-innovations-making-patients-point-care/">drones delivering medical supplies</a>; an ever-increasing wealth of data from <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/the-body-map-of-health-trackers-infographic/">personal health sensors</a>; and <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/covid-19-was-needed-for-telemedicine-to-finally-go-mainstream/">patients turning to telemedicine</a>, the medical workplace will decidedly look different by then.&nbsp;</p><p>But you also regularly hear news like how algorithms are able to <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/top-artificial-intelligence-companies-in-healthcare/">beat radiologists</a> to the punch when identifying cancerous lesions in medical images. These <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03847-z">can fuel fear</a> that such advanced technologies will put physicians out of their jobs. While the likes of artificial intelligence and robotics will indeed replace existing professions, it cannot be stressed enough that those same technologies will create new jobs. Consider how the automobile industry took over horse carriages in the early 20th century. Younger generations of horse carriage drivers did not lose their job <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/new-jobs-in-the-future-of-healthcare-medicine-i/">by adapting to the prevalent changes</a>, and shifted to using cars in their businesses.</p>
