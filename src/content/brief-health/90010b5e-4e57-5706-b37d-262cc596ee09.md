<p>With considerable pressure to develop workflow processes to manage the 10 million plus patient backlog, many NHS trusts are seeking to leverage technology to increase efficiencies.
3M Health Information (HIS) has developed and delivered its 3M M*Modal speech recognition solutions to support the NHS in development of workflow processes that simplify cliniciansâ€™ documentation.
With the introduction of Integrated Care Systems (ICSs), aggregated regional data sets can deliver insight to determine requirements, availability, and efficiency of resources, inform patient pathways and develop patient prioritisation models to tackle the current backlog - all underpinned by accurate source information.
As the expectation of high-quality care increases, there is an immediate necessity to automate and analyse data to drive better patient outcomes.</p>
