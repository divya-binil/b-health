<p>Integrated telemedicine solutions can address current pain points.<br><br>When hospital providers initiate an emergency telemedicine visit, they can access relevant patient demographic and insurance information collected by medics at the scene prior to hospital arrival, streamlining admission and care.
Direct-to-patient care: Telemedicine platforms can be integrated with providersâ€™ websites.
Extended care: EMS providers or nursing home staff can use integrated telemedicine systems to obtain physician consultations and complete treatment onsite for patients in the extended care facility, potentially reducing the number of costly, unnecessary transports to the emergency department (ED).
As telemedicine solutions mature, increasing adoption rates for both providers and patients will advance the growing area of community paramedicine, providing effective treatments at much lower costs than the ED.
The latest telemedicine technology can do everything we need it to and promises to improve access to care and reduce the billions of dollars lost in unnecessary EMS patient transports and ED visits.
When done right, integrated telemedicine solutions can be the golden thread that unites providers and patients, providing better treatment closer to home.</p>
