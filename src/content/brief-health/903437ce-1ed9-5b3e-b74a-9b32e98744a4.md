<p>In February of 2020, one month before Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, health system CIOs participated in a College of Health Information Management Executives (CHIME) survey to identify their top IT priorities and barriers to progress. A summary of this <a href="https://cerecore.net/2020-health-system-cio-priorities-chime-survey/">CHIME survey</a> revealed that optimizing EHR/EMR services was the top IT priority, followed by patient engagement and consumer technologies—telemedicine, interoperability and analytics. Operating costs pressure was cited as the biggest barrier to making progress with these various health IT initiatives.</p>
