<p>The Partnership for Health System Sustainability and Resilience emphasizes the need for digital transformation, even amid economic uncertainty. Jan-Willem Scheijgrond, global head of government and public affairs at Philips, unpacks the new report.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/new-research-urges-governments-invest-healthcare-digitization">Read on healthcareitnews.com</a></p><p>There are many reasons why governments should invest in healthcare digitization. Some of the main ones include the following:</p><p>1. Improved patient care: Digital technologies can help healthcare providers to improve the quality of care they provide to patients. For example, electronic health records can help doctors and nurses to access important information about a patient's medical history and current health status, allowing them to make more informed decisions about their treatment.</p><p>2. Increased efficiency: Healthcare digitization can help to make healthcare systems more efficient by streamlining processes and reducing the need for manual tasks. For example, electronic health records can help to reduce the amount of time that doctors and nurses spend on paperwork, allowing them to spend more time with patients.</p><p>3. Reduced costs: Healthcare digitization can help to reduce costs by reducing the need for paper records and other manual processes. This can help to free up funds that can be used for other purposes, such as hiring additional staff or investing in new medical technologies.</p><p>4. Improved access to care: Digital technologies can help to improve access to care, particularly in rural or remote areas where healthcare facilities may be limited. For example, telemedicine technology can allow doctors to provide care to patients over the phone or via video conferencing, reducing the need for patients to travel long distances to see a doctor.</p><p>Overall, investing in healthcare digitization can help to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare systems, and make it easier for people to access the care they need.&nbsp;</p>
