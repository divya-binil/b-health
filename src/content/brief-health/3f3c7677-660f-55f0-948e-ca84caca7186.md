<p>A worldwide scale of anxiety, loneliness and fear, associated with worrying about the virus, unemployment, social isolation and uncertainty added up to a mental state.<br>“Good mental health is absolutely fundamental to overall health and well-being,” – WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement on World Mental Health Day last year.
Mental health, or emotional hygiene has been thrown into the shade over the past years and that stigma only changes slowly.
One in six U.S. youth aged 6-17 experience a mental health disorder each year.</p><p>So how could a technological tool help manage stress which is induced partly by technologies?
In The Medical Futurist’s experience, you cannot really meditate or de-stress effectively with technology on the long-run.
It could work similarly to addictions: it might be easier for a technological society to get used to the idea of mediation and effective stress management through another digital tool, used less and less until completely losing it in the end.</p>
