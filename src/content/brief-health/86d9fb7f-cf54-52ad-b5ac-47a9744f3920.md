<p>Are Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and telehealth the same thing?
Remote patient monitoring is one specific form of telehealth that involves using a device to collect and transmit vital signs or physiologic data from a patient outside of the office.</p><p>While vaccinations and other public health measures are now enabling us to resume many pre-pandemic activities like routine doctors’ visits, there are many benefits of telehealth that will live beyond the pandemic, including:
– Eliminating language barriers: An interpreter can join a telehealth visit if English isn’t a patient’s first language.
RPM is a complement to routine appointments and provides a unique perspective since clinicians can collect information about the patient’s health between visits.
RPM can prevent possible deterioration in health between office visits.</p>
