<p>Healthcare is in the midst of a digital transformation, creating information security, compliance, and workflow challenges. The engagement of an increasingly decentralized workforce along with anytime anyplace healthcare and the proliferation of cloud-based applications, databases, and mobile devices have now (or soon will have) eroded the once well-defined network perimeter.</p><p>The healthcare industry remains one of the most highly targeted for cyber-attacks – <a href="https://www.beazley.com/news/2019/beazley_breach_insights_february_2019.html">a recent report from <i>Beazley Breach Insights</i></a><i> </i>showed that, 41 percent of all breaches in 2018 occurred in the healthcare sector.&nbsp;This means that, going forward, healthcare organizations must pay particular attention to cybersecurity and do so without restricting or compromising access to the systems and services providers and patients are now using and may do in the future. A successful cybersecurity plan requires these organizations to focus on establishing and managing trusted digital identities for all users, applications, and devices throughout the entire extended digital healthcare enterprise – from the hospital, to the cloud, and beyond.</p>
