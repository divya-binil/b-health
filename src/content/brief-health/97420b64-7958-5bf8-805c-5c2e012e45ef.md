<p>Leaders from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT offered some help for healthcare organizations who will face broader information blocking compliance in 2022 – specifically with regard to the sharing of electronic health information, or EHI.
But to &nbsp;give those covered entities a phased-in way of compliance, the info blocking rules covered only a subset of EHI – specifically information represented by the data elements identified byUnited States Core Data for Interoperability v1.
More can be learned in ONC's FAQs. But the basic definition is that it's electronic protected health information, ePHI, "to the extent that it would be included in a designated record set , regardless of whether the group of records are used or maintained by or for a covered entity."&nbsp;</p>
