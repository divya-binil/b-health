<p>Digital health solutions are becoming more popular, and they have a lot of potential to improve fairness, outcomes, and access to care. For healthcare organisations, they may also improve operational effectiveness and lower expenses. However, identifying the evidence needs for digital health solutions is a difficult undertaking that significantly depends on the solution's particular goal. Digital health solutions frequently do not respond well to conventional evaluation techniques like randomised control clinical trials. First, given their size and complexity, they are mainly incompatible with the frequently quick and iterative nature of software development. Furthermore, the data' limited generalizability to populations in the actual world is a result of their stringent inclusion criteria. Additionally, it takes a significant amount of time, money, and other resources to conduct clinical trials.</p>
