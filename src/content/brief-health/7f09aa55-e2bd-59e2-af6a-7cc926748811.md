<p>The academic medical center's physician chief of maternal fetal medicine explains how remote patient monitoring technology improves care during a very sensitive time in a woman's life.<br><br>The largest safety-net hospital in New England and an academic medical facility that is not for profit is Boston Medical Center. Children, teenagers, adults, and infants can all receive medical attention there.</p><p>At Boston Medical Center, Dr. Christina Yarrington is in charge of maternal-fetal medicine. Her primary concern as the obstetrics department's leader is making sure the facility's populace has the resources required to monitor patients who are at a high risk for postpartum hypertension in order to lower overall health risks without interfering with the crucial early stages of infant bonding at home.</p>
