<p>The way the United States currently handles its health care workforce has a number of significant concerns. High turnover rates exist. Burnout incidence is rising. An ageing population enrolling in Medicare is increasing the demand for care. Many signs point to it being worse before it gets better. Through my job, I speak with healthcare executives every day who feel like they've reached their breaking point. One leader in the physician services industry compared his company like a water glass that has been overfilled and is shaking uncontrollably on a paper serviette. In order to prevent the glass from tipping over or at the very least from soaking the serviette, he is attempting to build for flexibility and resilience.</p>
