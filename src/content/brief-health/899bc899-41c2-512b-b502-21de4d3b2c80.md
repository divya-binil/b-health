<p>Zoom announced this week that it had launched an integration option with Cerner's electronic health record platform.
"With virtual care here to stay, providers must focus on delivering a seamless experience for telehealth visits – one that’s easy, intuitive, and frictionless for patients, and secure, trusted and simple from a clinical standpoint," wrote Zoom Global Healthcare Lead Ron Emerson in a post about the announcement.
Cerner users at hospitals, health systems, physician offices and clinics will be able to launch secure Zoom visits directly within EHR workflows, the companies say.
"Zoom’s ability to integrate with popular electronic health record platforms, including Cerner and Epic, makes it even easier to schedule, join, and document telehealth visits directly in a patient’s EHR," wrote Emerson.</p>
