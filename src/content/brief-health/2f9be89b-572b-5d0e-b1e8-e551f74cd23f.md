<p>The health data business just closed a $200 million structured equity infusion, according to TechCrunch and Fierce Healthcare. As part of a bigger business restructure, health data firm Komodo Health has let go of 9% of its personnel. The cofounders of Komodo, Arif Nathoo and Web Sun, stated in a letter to staff members that was also published on LinkedIn that the COVID-19 pandemic presented chances for the analytics firm. However, the current state of the economy is making its clients think twice before making any purchases. As an organisation, "we continue to be well positioned to weather these changes," they stated. "We provide crucial visibility into the healthcare system to assist the strategic decisions corporate healthcare leaders need to make." That being stated, we have a duty to everyone.</p>
