<p>Urban Health Plan tested eClinicalWorks' healow prediction algorithm and increased its show rate for the patients most likely to miss their appointments by 154% with targeted interventions.</p><p>The New York City-based Urban Health Plan used artificial intelligence to improve operational efficiency and patient care and got a handle on its annually high patient no-show rates with cost-effective patient interventions.</p><h2><strong>Higher-than-average missed appointments</strong></h2><p>No-shows are due to multiple factors, including social determinants of health like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hpoe.org/Reports-HPOE/2017/sdoh-transportation-role-of-hospitals.pdf">transportation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But they are also a long-standing challenge to healthcare organizations that can affect the patient's care quality, increase healthcare organization costs and present unnecessary reductions in overall patient access to healthcare appointments.</p><p>In March, Urban Health Plan had 42,000 health visits â€“ the highest in its history, according to a presentation at an eClinicalWorks health summit in Boston last week.&nbsp;</p><p>"We had a multifaceted approach to just addressing patient access and engagement overall," <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/himss21-changemaker-podcast-alison-connelly-flores-urban-health-plan">Alison Connelly-Flores</a>, chief medical information officer of Urban Health Plan,&nbsp;told&nbsp;<i>Healthcare IT News</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>That achievement is significant because annually, UHP experiences a high number of missed appointments and appointments for patients waiting are sometimes "booked out way too far." Providers are typically overbooked to accommodate for no-shows, said Connelly-Flores.<br><br><a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/fqhc-slashed-its-patient-no-show-rate-ai-3-months">Read on healthcareitnews.com</a></p>
