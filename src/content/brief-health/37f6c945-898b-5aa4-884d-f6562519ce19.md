<p>As in other businesses, there are affluent and marginalized payers in the health care sector. Which health insurance companies can offer products at wholesale prices, benefiting themselves while relying on providers and institutions to make up for decreased reimbursements through patient volume, depends on the number of people covered. Unless they can obtain uncommon waivers from providers or institutions, uninsured patients normally pay retail pricing. Due to the complicated nature of health care economics, which even providers and institutions might not completely comprehend, these waivers are uncommon. Because of this, patients who pay for themselves frequently become involved in these difficulties. The burden of society's health care costs must be borne by marginalized payers and their clients. Pay equity is a goal for both organisations and healthcare providers.</p>
