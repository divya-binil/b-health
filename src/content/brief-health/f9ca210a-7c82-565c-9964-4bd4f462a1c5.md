<p>A patient's medical history includes years of data reflecting their medical conditions, co-morbidities, medications, laboratory results and additional information related to their health and well-being. While this data can be valuable in helping doctors, pharmacists and other clinicians optimize patient care, the challenge often comes down to how it is accessed, stored and shared.</p><p>Health data can be housed within numerous silos, including data stores, electronic health records and health information exchanges, making it difficult for members of a patient's care team to share information and harness its collective insights. Despite comprehensive health data being critical for improving outcomes and providing timely and cost-effective care, it's not always readily available. This often requires patients to provide their information through a manual process, which presents more opportunities for human error.</p>
