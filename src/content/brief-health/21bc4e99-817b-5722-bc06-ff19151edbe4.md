<p>A range of sectors have begun to utilise Blockchain for a variety of use-cases, including health and social care.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to innovation in the fight against COVID-19, much of the emphasis and investment has been channelled into securing a vaccine (and rightly so), with this seemingly now being the ‘exit strategy’ for most governments.</p><p>However, as the pandemic continues to stress-test some of the very best healthcare systems across the globe, including our own NHS, a question remains as to whether there are any pioneering technologies available to support the UK’s health and social care sectors, right now.</p><p>This is where we at TrueProfile.io believe that blockchain has the capacity to make an immediate difference in the fight against COVID-19, principally when it comes to ensuring the healthcare sector can efficiently and securely obtain the staff and skills it needs.</p><p><a href="https://www.healthtechdigital.com/fighting-covid-19-does-blockchain-have-a-role-to-play/">Read on healthtechdigital.com</a></p>
