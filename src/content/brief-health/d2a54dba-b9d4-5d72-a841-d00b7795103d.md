<p>The real-world cohort study revealed significantly improved health-related outcomes in patients with low back pain- The digital care program (DCP) for low back pain (LBP) had substantial improvements in disability (55.1%), pain (61.0%), mental health (decrease in depression (55%) and anxiety (59%) ), surgery likelihood (59.1%) and productivity (65.6%), which were associated with high engagement and satisfaction levels. Sword Health, the leading digital musculoskeletal (MSK) solution on the market, today released clinical study results that show significant improvement in health-related outcomes for patients with Acute Low Back Pain.
The study, published in the Journal of Pain Research, focused on clinical outcomes in members going through Sword’s care programs for acute low back pain.
This study validates Sword’s digital care programs for acute LBP as a way to effectively tackle this problem, even in individuals at high risk of becoming chronic sufferers, highlighting the importance of multimodal care managed by physical therapists.
Another clinical study from Sword Health, published in BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders in January, revealed equally impressive outcomes in patients going through Sword’s digital care programs for acute conditions involving several body areas, along with leading adherence and retention rates.</p>
