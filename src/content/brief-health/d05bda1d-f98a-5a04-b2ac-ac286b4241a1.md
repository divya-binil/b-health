<p>As digital health companies solidify their services and technologies as a preference for many, and innovations continue to be developed, it’s critical for healthcare startups to understand the needs of patients and physicians.
Many new medical tools and technologies being developed ultimately end up in a doctor’s office, prompting the need for startups to collaborate with physicians during the research and development phase.
Beyond verifying medical accuracy, physicians can provide exclusive insights to help navigate any number of strategic issues or healthcare challenges that may be unseen to a startup, as well as inform any gaps in a new tool or technology such as a potential feature or add-on recommendation based on what they are seeing in the field.
Complementing their medical expertise, physicians also serve as the voice of the patient; with a growing emphasis on tools and technologies being developed specifically for patient use and improved health outcomes, physicians are a valuable asset in informing startups with unique patient perspectives during the R&amp;D phase.
As such, startups should approach their innovations and market strategy with the understanding that patients will do their own research and read the fine print before buying into a new product or technology.
Whether the latest innovation is in the research and development phase or ready to go to market, the on-demand marketplace for physicians allows startups to remain at the forefront of medicine and conserve their time in identifying the right expertise by posting a job with unique parameters to recruit experts from a broad range of specialties.</p>
