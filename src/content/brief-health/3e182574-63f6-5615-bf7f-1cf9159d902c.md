<p>Patients with diabetes and high blood pressure are benefiting from artificial technology that turns a smartphone camera into a clinical-grade tool which can detect early kidney disease.</p><p>NHSX is supporting Healthy.io to offer 500,000 patients technology-supported home-testing kits over the next 3 years. More than 3,500 patients have already received their kits.</p><p>Patients taking part receive a simple test kit and smartphone app that allows them to test, scan and transmit their results to their GP within minutes, without leaving home.</p><p>The technology developed by Healthy.io essentially turns patients’ smartphone cameras into medical devices – analysing testing images and producing results regardless of lighting conditions, setting or camera type.</p><p>Matthew Gould, chief executive of NHSX, said: “Artificial intelligence holds enormous potential for the NHS and in many areas is already providing radical benefits for patients and clinicians.</p><p>“The use of this latest testing technology is another huge step forward enabling us to provide earlier diagnosis of disease and improve patient care and treatment outcomes while also freeing up NHS staff.”</p><p>Healthy.io’s technology is one of 42 innovations that are being supported by the <a href="https://www.digitalhealth.net/2020/09/government-announces-50m-diagnostic-products-under-national-ai-lab/">first round of the&nbsp;AI&nbsp;in Health and Care Award programme</a>, managed by the Accelerated Access Collaborative in partnership with NHSX and the National Institute for Health Research.</p>
