<p>HIMSS has provided written comments to The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regarding the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act around cybersecurity practices.
HIMSS recommends OCR implement policies that only afford enforcement discretion to situations involving use of security best practices as that discretion applies to safeguarding electronic protected health information (PHI) and not to other areas that are within the scope of HIPAA.</p>
