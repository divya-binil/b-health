<p>A new study is to look into how artificial intelligence could be used to reduce the length of time it takes to diagnose women who are at a higher risk of breast cancer.</p><p>Google Health has teamed up with Northwestern Medicine to explore whether artificial intelligence (AI) could prioritise reviews of mammograms with a higher suspicion of breast cancer.</p><p>The model is trained to quickly find mammograms which need further review and flags them to radiologists. Women whose mammograms show a higher likelihood of breast cancer might be able to be seen the same day for follow up, according to a statement from Northwestern Medicine.</p><p>Dr Sarah Friedewald, associate professor of radiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said: “With the use of artificial intelligence, we hope to expedite the process to diagnosis of breast cancer by identifying suspicious findings on patients’ screening examinations earlier than the standard of care.</p>
