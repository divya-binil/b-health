<p>If the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes or approves a COVID-19 vaccine, ACIP will quickly hold a public meeting to review all available data about that vaccine (sign up to receive email updates whenever <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/index.html#tabs-2-3">ACIPâ€™s Meeting Information</a>&nbsp;is updated). From these data, ACIP will then vote on whether to recommend the vaccine and, if so, who should receive it.</p><p>On December 1, 2020, ACIP made recommendations on who should be offered COVID-19 vaccination in the initial phase of the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program while there is limited vaccine supply. ACIP will meet again after FDA has authorized or approved specific COVID-19 vaccines and will make recommendations for the use of individual vaccines at that time.</p>
