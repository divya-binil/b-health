<p>More broadly, Medicaid Modularity is about improving states’ Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS).<br><br>Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS).
In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) followed by issuing guidance on how states should move forward with modularity of their MMIS with a goal of providing enhanced flexibility to change systems.
The new modularity standard allows states to keep large vendors to leverage the benefits but gain the flexibility to carve off different pieces of the business, partner with new vendors and improve other systems.
That said, based on my own direct experience with MMIS modularity implementations, there are a handful of takeaways to help guide states through the process: 
1. Timing is Crucial in Implementation – As states begin to consider new approaches for their Medicaid modularity, it is important to gain a firm handle on the level and type of resources needed for the implementation of modular systems, including the time and staff required.
2. Data Gathering Modules Should Come First – While each MMIS will have different modules, based on data gathered from RFPs, states are investing in an enterprise service bus (ESB) or data warehouse (DSS) because they’re versatile and incorporate data feeds from other modules with legacy vendors.
States will be able to get around long-term issues by implementing DSS first because data mapping from an old to a new vendor is less problematic when setting up a new hub and conducting tests with the DSS.</p>
