<p>If your business’s legal health depends on signed agreements with clients – we’re looking at you, healthcare organizations, law firms, financial service providers – you know the federal E-Sign ACT gives electronically signed contracts the same legal status as those signed on paper.
If the e-signature solution you used to secure the signed agreement doesn’t allow you to meet any of these (or other) conditions, you might not be able to legally enforce the contract.
To satisfy the above elements of the E-Sign Act (signer’s affirmative consent, record integrity, etc.), and prevail in a legal dispute, you’ll need your e-signature app to offer advanced digital protection and anti-fraud measures, including:
Taken together, these make up the unique characteristics of blockchain, which is why government agencies and corporations are increasingly turning to this technology to secure their most valuable and sensitive electronic data.
A report by Concord Law School, explaining blockchain’s legal admissibility as digital evidence, notes that several large corporations are already using the technology to secure highly sensitive data.
If international corporations with billions of dollars at stake – and even federal agencies with data as sensitive as the Defense Department – trust their electronic records to blockchain technology, why would you want to record and store your company’s signed contracts with anything less proven and secure?
Until now, you didn’t have any choice but to entrust your electronic signatures to more traditional cybersecurity protocols, because no e-signature app offered blockchain technology.
jSign can protect your company’s electronic records in a digital environment that leverages all the security, decentralization and anti-fraud benefits of the blockchain.</p>
