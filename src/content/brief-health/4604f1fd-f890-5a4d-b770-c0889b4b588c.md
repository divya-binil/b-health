    Medical research goes through peer review before publication in a journal to
    ensure that the findings are reliable and suitable for the audience. Peer
    review is important for preventing false claims, minimizing bias, and
    avoiding plagiarism. It helps ensure that any claims really are
    'evidence-based.'
