<p>Yet, tracking and measuring progress for these programs will be critical to demonstrating value.
Measuring that progress typically falls into four main categories: Financial Return, User Satisfaction (Experience), Effectiveness, and Technical Performance. Although measuring financial outcomes is important, targeting a specific return can be challenging for emerging technologies when very little unbiased data are available.
Instead of establishing a targeted return, it’s recommended that the potential financial improvements are identified early, then measured over time with trends in volume.
The effective human-centered design ensures an optimal experience for all end users, but ongoing measurement is required to validate expectations are continuously being met.
Operational improvements and clinical outcomes are two key areas to measure for efficacy.
To ensure that the technology in question is effectively supporting a program, two key areas are required.
Second, is the end user perception which can be gathered as part of user satisfaction data but may be simplified to star ratings to improve response rate.
Financial ROI is highly dependent on end-user satisfaction and effectiveness.
Tracking and measuring progress in these areas will be critical to proving telehealth programs are supporting a healthcare organization’s strategic goals.</p>
