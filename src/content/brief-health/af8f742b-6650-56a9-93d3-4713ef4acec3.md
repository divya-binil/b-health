<p>The new FDA draft guidance for clinical decision support software is an important step forward but still has a long way to go.<br><br>Roughly two years after <a href="https://www.chilmarkresearch.com/fda-guidance-clinical-decision-support/">we reviewed the first FDA guidance</a> on Clinical Decision Support (CDS), <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/109618/download">FDA issued new draft</a> guidance. The FDA was <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/fda-reneged-its-promise-take-risk-based-approach-cds-software">criticized</a> for not basing their first draft regulation criteria on use-case risk. Since then the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF), which the FDA chaired, <a href="http://www.imdrf.org/docs/imdrf/final/technical/imdrf-tech-140918-samd-framework-risk-categorization-141013.pdf">created a framework</a> for organizing Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) by risk categories. While CDS is a very broad category that encompasses many functions, this guidance could have an outsize impact on the need to provide transparency in <a href="https://www.chilmarkresearch.com/ai-ml-in-healthcare-part-of-the-toolkit-for-administrators-and-clinicians/">AI/ML platforms and algorithms for healthcare</a>.</p>
