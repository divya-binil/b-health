    description: >-
      Accuhealth was formed when a group of cybersecurity professionals teamed
      up with a medical director to reinvent the healthcare experience for
      physicians and patients completely. Traditional primary care experience,
      mired with inefficiencies, long wait times, crowded offices, exposure
      concerns, and questionable health outcomes, was ready for a paradigm
      change. After a thorough analysis of the telehealth marketplace, it was
      clear that current solutions fell short of meeting Accuhealth's vision.


      Accuhealth listened and delivered the market-leading solution built on the
      same tools Enterprises deploy and address every clinic need regardless of
      scale. Accuhealth provides out of the box payer integration; secure
      instant messaging, video calls, and EHR integration. Accuhealth maintains
      Clinics within their EHR ecosystem to seamlessly monitor and connect
      virtually with patients for improved patient care, patient satisfaction,
      and patient loyalty.
