<p>In the past, Dr. Caren Campbell of Bay Area-based Caren Campbell MD Dermatology had worked for practices that used a variety of electronic health records.</p><p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong></p><p>But none of these EHRs offered online scheduling or online check-in (pre-visit paperwork) for patients prior to arrival â€“ or&nbsp;if they did, they were incredibly expensive. When Campbell was opening her new practice, she shopped around for an EHR that could help keep staffing to a minimum and administrative burden low.</p><p><strong>PROPOSAL</strong></p><p>She decided on the cloud-based EHR developed by vendor DrChrono.</p><p>"They offer online scheduling, online check-in and a patient portal that is user-friendly.&nbsp;And the EHR can be used on a desktop, phone or tablet," Campbell explained. "It is at an affordable price point, and the customer service team is responsive. I could create a seamless experience for patients by integrating the scheduling links within my website and have them see a branded booking site."</p><p>Online scheduling cuts down on administrative burden for the office.&nbsp;The practice is able to increase the number of patients and appointments without having to have staff answer and set appointments for patients, she added.</p>
