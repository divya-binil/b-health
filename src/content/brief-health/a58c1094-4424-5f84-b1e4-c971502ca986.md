Long patient waits – and even waiting rooms themselves – may be things of the past, says one physician expert.<br><br>Before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, patients often had to wait for hours in hospital and doctor's office waiting rooms. After the pandemic quickly mainstreamed telehealth and prescheduling technologies, patient wait times were significantly reduced.</p><p>So what does this mean for patients and providers moving forward?</p><p>Dr. David Berg, cofounder and chairman of the board of Redirect Health, a primary care national healthcare organization featuring telemedicine and mobile health, believes the healthcare industry should reduce unnecessary inconveniences – such as extensive travel or wait times – from the healthcare experience.</p>
