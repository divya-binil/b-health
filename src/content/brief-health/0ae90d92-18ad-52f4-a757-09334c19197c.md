The past few years have been marked with significant innovation in applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to healthcare, including improved imaging and data-powered diagnostics, workflow improvement strategies to enhance provider experiences and decrease errors, and direct-to-patient chatbots to provide behavioral healthcare or chronic disease management. As the biomedical and healthcare sectors consider new applications of AI in healthcare, it is important to consider the broader impact that these technologies will have on patient experiences of medicine. A major factor that will influence the nature and extent of AI innovation in healthcare will be whether, and under what conditions, patients accept AI. As a result, AI creators need to anticipate patient responses to AI applications in healthcare.
