<p>The Telehealth Benefit Expansion for Workers Act would permit employers to provide stand-alone telehealth benefits to employees, much like dentistry and vision insurance. A bipartisan bill to increase access to employer-sponsored telehealth coverage was introduced, according to a news release from U.S. Representatives Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., Tim Walberg, D-Mich., Angie Craig, D-Minn., Ron Estes, R-Kan., Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., and Rick Allen, R-Ga. The Telehealth Benefit Expansion for Workers Act would permit companies to provide workers with independent telehealth benefits, comparable to dental and vision plans, in addition to conventional healthcare insurance, according to the press release. All employees, including part-time and seasonal workers, would be permitted to use telehealth services thanks to the proposed legislation. In accordance with this legislation, standalone telehealth benefits would continue to be distinct from conventional healthcare plans.&nbsp;In recent years, several legislations have been introduced to expand the use of telehealth and address various issues related to it. Some of the key legislations include:</p><ul><li>The 21st Century Cures Act (2016): This act includes provisions to expand the use of telehealth, including telemedicine, for Medicare beneficiaries.</li><li>The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) (2015): This act includes provisions to encourage the use of telehealth for patients in rural areas.</li><li>The Veterans Affairs Telehealth Services Expansion Act (2017): This act expands telehealth services for veterans and provides funding for telehealth services and infrastructure.</li><li>The Connected Government Act (2018): This act requires federal agencies to consider telehealth as a tool to provide health services and support telehealth initiatives.</li><li>The Telehealth Modernization Act (2021): This act aims to expand telehealth services and provide more flexibility for telehealth providers.</li><li>The COVID-19 Emergency Telehealth Flexibility Act (2020): This act temporarily expands telehealth services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including allowing for telehealth services to be provided in patients' homes.</li></ul><p>These legislations aim to increase access to telehealth services, improve patient outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs. However, there are still challenges related to reimbursement, privacy, and security that need to be addressed in order to fully realize the potential of telehealth.</p>
