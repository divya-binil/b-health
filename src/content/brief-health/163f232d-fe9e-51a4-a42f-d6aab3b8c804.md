<p>The world is desperate for a reliable vaccine against COVID-19. However, the pressure for such rapid introduction could lead to deployment of a vaccine that may be weakly effective.</p><p>In order to avoid this from happening, three issues must be considered when planning COVID-19 vaccine trials. These include proof of vaccine efficacy and worthwhile efficacy, whether these trials should prioritise single-vaccine or multivaccine trials and whether the assessment of long-term safety and protection should be evaluated during follow-up and before an effective vaccine is deployed for the general public.</p><p>The problem is that most nations are under immense political and economic pressure to introduce a COVID-19 vaccine. This pressure could result in the deployment of a weak vaccine which could be the output of a misleading promising result from an underpowered trial. This could be disastrous because the deployment of a weak vaccine could worsen the pandemic. If people begin to think they are protected and immune, they could relax with respect to complying with COVID-19 control measures. This could put them and other people at risk of contracting the virus. Also, because a vaccine&nbsp;would be deployed, other clinical trials in process of evaluating&nbsp;other vaccines would be hindered because their vaccine would be compared with this vaccine instead of a placebo. And in case the vaccine that is being compared to the already deployed weak vaccine is&nbsp;even weaker, the weak vaccine would be classified as superior (even though both vaccines are weak).</p><p><a href="https://healthmanagement.org/c/icu/news/better-planning-of-covid-19-vaccine-trials">Read on healthmanagement.org</a></p>
