<p>We strongly believe that only digital health can bring healthcare into the 21st century and make patients the point-of-care.<br><br>During your school years, you might have encountered several instances where your teacher laid out a task or asked a question, and asked you and your classmates to come up with an answer or solution. This “method” somewhat exemplifies crowdsourcing, albeit in analogue form. In essence, <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/crowdsourcing">the term refers to</a> the act of gathering information or input into a task from a large group of people; or simply, “<i>outsourcing work to the crowd</i>” as the <i>Wired </i>editors who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">coined the term in 2005</a> described it.&nbsp;</p><p>However, one must not confuse crowd<i>sourcing</i> with crowd<i>funding</i>. The latter involves raising relatively small amounts of funds from a large group of individuals to realise a project. It’s the method employed to fund campaigns on Kickstarter and Indiegogo; or GoFundMe, where there’s <a href="https://mashable.com/article/crowdfunding-medical-bills-survey/">a worrying trend in the U.S.</a> for people turning to crowdfunding to pay their medical bills.</p>
