<p>Dr. Louis Jeansonne, chief medical information officer at <a href="https://www.ochsner.org/">Ochsner Health</a>, explains that the Triple Aim is focused on patient experience while the Quadruple Aim adds emphasis on clinician experience and employee engagement. That includes using CC&amp;C tools to help physicians avoid burnout.</p><p>Physicians at Ochsner use Epic’s mobile messaging app HAIKU, and clinicians use Epic Rover to see schedules, X-rays and radiology images without going to a computer. The health system also uses the scheduling app Lightning Bolt to keep track of who is on call. “That feeds into Epic, our EMR, so that nurses can go in the system,” Jeansonne says. “They can see who’s on call, and they can send them a message. We don’t have to know everyone’s number.”</p><p>With physicians spread across the Ochsner system’s locations in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, the ability to get ahold of one of 3,000 physicians makes the CC&amp;C app a “really powerful tool,” Jeansonne says.</p>
