<p>Andy Molnar, CEO of the Digital Therapeutics Alliance, discusses the market for digital therapeutics after Pear Therapeutics declared bankruptcy. The state of investments in digital therapeutics, issues with standards of care, adoption barriers, and strategies for success in the field have all been discussed since Pear Therapeutics, one of the first companies to develop digital therapeutics, filed for bankruptcy in April. MobiHealthNews sat down with Andy Molnar, CEO of the Digital Therapeutics Alliance, a nonprofit that offers thought leadership and education to advance the adoption of digital therapeutics, to get his perspective on the market for these products and how Pear's bankruptcy has impacted the sector. MobiHealthNews: What's happening in the field of digital therapies, and how do you think the collapse of Pear is affecting the market? Andy Molnar: This was one of the first years we saw Medicaid coverage advance, making it such a strange year.</p>
