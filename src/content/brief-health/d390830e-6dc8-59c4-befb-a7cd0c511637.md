<p>Chicago’s influential healthcare leaders will converge at the HIMSS Global Health Conference &amp; Exhibition, widely considered the Davos Summit of healthcare and information technology, to discover Health that Connects + Tech that Cares. HIMSS23, which will take place in Chicago from April 17–21, is already accepting general registrations. Leading healthcare workforce experts and innovators come together at HIMSS23 for can't-miss trainings, seminars, educational events, and exhibitions. A resolution honouring HIMSS and expressing the city of Chicago's sincere gratitude and congratulations on the 2023 HIMSS World Health Conference &amp; Exposition was approved by the Chicago City Council on March 15. NFL safety Damar Hamlin, Moody's Mark Zandi, Ben Nemtin of The Buried Life movement, healthcare experts from NBC News, Best Buy Health, HealthPartners, VillageMD, and more are among the featured speakers at HIMSS23. Join Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, and other public health officials as they discuss ways to provide a contemporary, adaptable public health data infrastructure to advance the two-way exchange of information.</p>
