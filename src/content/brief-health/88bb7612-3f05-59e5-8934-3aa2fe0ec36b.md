<p>COVID-19 forced seniors to start looking for technology-based solutions more than ever before. <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2021/1/seniors-and-technology-during-covid">According to reports</a>, they are more connected to the Internet than ever before, as loneliness and isolation forced them to use their devices extensively. A <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/survey-shows-seniors-are-embracing-technology-and-telehealth-during-pandemic">survey in the U.S. found</a> that the overall use of telemedicine services among seniors increased by 300% during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>Acquiring digital skills became a must, but, due to the lockdowns and worrying about their health, most of them have lost their support network in tech –&nbsp;children, grandchildren and other more computer literate family members. Learning how to use these tools, however, contributes to the everyday lives and wellbeing of seniors – and this is a gap technology companies in healthcare must overcome.</p>
