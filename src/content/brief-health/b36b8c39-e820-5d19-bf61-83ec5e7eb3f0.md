<p>The goal of this partnership between GoodRx (NASDAQ: GDRX), a top consumer-focused digital healthcare platform, and Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) is to enhance the patient and healthcare professional (HCP) experience while beginning a new specialised therapy. HCPs can now locate the enrollment form and submit it to the speciality hub through Provider Mode if they have chosen to prescribe VUMERITY® (diroximel fumarate) to patients with relapse forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). GoodRx's Provider Mode, which was just unveiled, is a new experience created especially for HCPs to assist them in accessing solutions for the pharmaceuticals they recommend. In the US, there are more than a million people who have MS. It can be difficult for HCPs to start patients on specialist medicines for illnesses like MS because of the documentation involved.</p>
