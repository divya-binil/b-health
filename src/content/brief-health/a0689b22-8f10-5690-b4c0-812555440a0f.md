Nurse-led innovation is essential for optimizing workflow and should be encouraged and supported by health systems, product suppliers and academic settings. Nurses bring added value to the innovation space through their consistent focus on patient safety and quality while maintaining a high standard of care.<br>&nbsp;</p>
