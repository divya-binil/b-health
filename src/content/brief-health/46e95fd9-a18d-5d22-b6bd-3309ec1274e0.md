<p>After a year in operation, the UNC Health Advanced Care at Home program has received the 2022 Highsmith Award for Innovation from the North Carolina Healthcare Association.
Additionally, this program also provides the care team insight into a patient’s home situation, which can have a significant impact on their health.” As the pandemic raged on during the delta and omicron variant waves in the second half of 2021 and early 2022, shifting care to a patient’s home not only kept them safe and comfortable, but also freed up hospital space and staff for critically ill COVID patients, according to UNC Health.
“Sick but stable” patients received 24/7 virtual care and UNC Health clinicians carried out patient-care plans deploying a network of in-home service providers including paramedics, skilled nurses, lab services, mobile imaging, therapy, and more.</p>
