title: Humana asked experts to define ‘value-based care.’ They couldn't do it.
---

Humana convened some of the healthcare industry’s greatest minds to build a consensus on the definitions of oft-used, but rather nebulous, concepts like “value-based care” and “population health.” 

There was just one problem, however: the experts couldn’t figure it out either.

Humana released a look at the results of the panel’s discussions first to FierceHealthcare, and although the participants could find common ground on what “value-based payment” is, they couldn't agree when it came to “value-based care” and “population health.”
