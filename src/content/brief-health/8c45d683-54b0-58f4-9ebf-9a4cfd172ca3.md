<p>By leveraging ML and artificial intelligence services, 3M will expedite, refine and scale the delivery of its real-time speech recognition platform, the company says. Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Comprehend Medical, and Amazon Transcribe Medical are some of the M*Modal ambient intelligence machine learning and generative AI technologies that 3M Health Information Systems has announced a partnership with Amazon Web technologies to advance and innovate. According to the firm, more than 300,000 physicians utilise M*Modal for real-time speech recognition compatible amd ambient clinical documentation. It is compatible with more than 250 electronic health records. By automating structured notes in the EHR, AI technology can assist physicians in concentrating more on providing direct patient care. Conversational AI will be further scaled and expedited with the usage of Amazon Bedrock's generative AI service, according to 3M, enabling increased flexibility and usability for end users. "Through ambient capabilities from 3M, our doctors can concentrate on what they do best."</p>
