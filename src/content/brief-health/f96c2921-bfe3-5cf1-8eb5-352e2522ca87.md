<p>It is estimated that 50% of the U.S. population has a chronic disease, and caring for them is consuming 86% of healthcare costs.
Some health systems are beginning to reconfigure care models to proactively care for patients with chronic conditions and illnesses, and a key component of this is implementing remote patient monitoring services.
RPM allows for patients to share data in a non-clinical setting (like their home) and receive care assessments and recommendations between visits.
To get insights into this technologically enhanced care for chronic conditions, we talked with Sarah Carroll, senior director of the Center for Care Transformation at AVIA, a healthcare digital transformation technology and services company.
Remote patient monitoring improves chronic care management by collecting and sharing biometric data and patient-reported insights with care teams who evaluate trends and intervene, if necessary.
Remote monitoring shifts care from hospital to home and can delay or reduce disease progression and costly treatments.
We've estimated that for every 500 high-risk Medicare patients with multiple chronic conditions, health systems can realize $5.2 million in annual cost savings.</p>
