<p>Here are five key trends that are driving their purchasing decisions within an evolving healthcare IT ecosystem. Signify Research has had the chance to meet with hundreds of C-suite health IT executives and departmental decision-makers as the healthcare industry continues to change and shift with providers dealing with rising financial burdens and changing patient expectations. Our discussions with these healthcare executives have given us a better understanding of their companies' technological and commercial plans. It has also clarified their perspectives on the most important issues facing the sector. Here are the top five trends influencing their purchasing choices in the dynamic healthcare IT market.
