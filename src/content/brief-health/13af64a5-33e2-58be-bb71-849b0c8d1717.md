<p>Spending a career in health IT means I have heard many interpretations &ndash; both right and wrong &ndash; of the often-cited patient privacy law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. Unfortunately, those who have not studied these highly complex rules are very likely to misinterpret it. This is not surprising, as a law degree and time on the bench is likely needed to make sense of the complicated legalese in the 115-page document.</p>
