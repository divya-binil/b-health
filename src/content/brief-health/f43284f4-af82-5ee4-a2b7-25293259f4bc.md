<p>The intersection of precision medicine and public health is a new and developing field called precision public health. Protecting and enhancing people's and their communities' health is the main goal of public health. In order to improve the health of entire communities, it promotes health through education, programmes, and science that supports the prevention, identification, and eventual treatment of infectious and chronic diseases.</p><p>Public health has always been significant, but now more than ever because of the COVID-19 epidemic. In order to better diagnose, contain, and divert health resources to where they are most needed, policymakers around the world have realised how crucial it is to have diagnostic testing infrastructure combined with data-driven decision-making in place.</p>
