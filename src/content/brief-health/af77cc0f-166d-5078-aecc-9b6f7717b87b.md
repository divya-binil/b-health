<p>Artificial intelligence (A.I.), machine learning (ML) and algorithms; if you are a regular at The Medical Futurist, you’ve come across these terms more than once whether it’s in our articles, videos or e-books. Indeed, our latest <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/5-things-we-learnt-about-investments-in-digital-health-new-e-book">e-book about investment in digital health</a> has a dedicated section about A.I.</p><p>Even The Medical Futurist Institute’s <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/a-physicians-visual-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/">latest peer-reviewed study</a> was published as a guide for medical professionals about the technology. But it’s not just us with a fascination for the sci-fi-esque technology, the healthcare A.I. market <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/826993/health-ai-market-value-worldwide/">is a booming one</a>, as is <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/new-study-the-state-of-artificial-intelligence-based-fda-approved-medical-devices-and-algorithms-an-online-database/">life science research</a> around the technology.</p><p>As A.I. becomes quasi-omnipresent in medicine, the hype factor comes into play. With the interest around the technology, companies might throw the term around left and right; claiming their solution uses A.I. when in fact, they only use a spreadsheet with some macros in it. All of these word-plays to entice investors gain more attention and play the marketing game.&nbsp;</p>
