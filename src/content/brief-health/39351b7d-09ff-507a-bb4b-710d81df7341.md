<p>While some healthcare professionals did prefer ChatGPT’s responses when compared to physicians' answers in one study, Kellogg researchers say it's too early to tell whether AI could really be a match for doctors' expertise and bedside manner. A recent study found that artificial intelligence chatbot assistants may respond to patients' health inquiries with similar quality and empathy to that of doctor-written responses. This study was just published in JAMA Internal Medicine. A group of licenced healthcare professionals compared doctors' and the chatbot's responses to queries posted by patients in October 2022 on the social media forum Reddit's r/AskDocs, but they were decisively convinced by those provided by ChatGPT in late December. "The chatbot responses were preferred over physician responses and rated significantly higher for both quality and empathy," the study's authors write.
