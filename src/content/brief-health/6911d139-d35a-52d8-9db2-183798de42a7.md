<p>Butler County Health Care Center in David City, Nebraska, dodged a malware attack planted just before July 4th, thanks to quick action by the FBI.
The IT director for Butler County Health Care Center, Cynthia Neesen, worked with the FBI to identify the compromised server and took it offline.
Past ransomware attacks have also been able to compromise data like patient names, social security numbers, dates of birth, home addresses, provider and specific health information. It's becoming regular news for the FBI, Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and others to issue warnings of ransomware aimed at healthcare organizations.
In June, the FBI announced it had thwarted an August 2021 attack by Iran-sponsored hackers on Boston Children's Hospital after getting a report from one of its intelligence partners before the attack could damage the hospital's infrastructure.</p>
