<p>On the eve of RSNA 2022, the Radiological Society of North America's annual international forum, which will be held in Chicago from November 27 to December 1, emtelligent, a pioneer in the development of clinical-grade natural language processing (NLP) software for healthcare organisations, announced today the continued expansion of its emtelliSuiteTM family of apps. By gaining access to difficult-to-access medical data, the emtelliSuite suite of apps aims to increase patient safety and the standard of treatment. EmtelliSuite makes use of emtelligent's patented and custom-built, enterprise-scale emtelliProÂ® NLP engine, which provides meaningful clinical insights from unstructured medical literature. At emtelligent's booth 4449 in the South Exhibit Hall at McCormick Place, guests of RSNA 2022 can test out the emtelliPro and emtelliSuite apps. Efficiency is increased via emtelliSuite applications and the emtelliPro medical NLP platform.</p>
