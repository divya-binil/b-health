<p>Medical communication company Vocera is teaming up with Amazon to build a new skill on Alexa aimed at making patients’ hospital experience more connected.
Tapping into an Amazon Echo in their room, patients will be able to just speak requests for a care team member.
Employing Vocera Engage software, the new skill will be able to decipher phrases and keywords in order to contact the appropriate caregiver for the patient’s request.
“We’re excited to work with Vocera and extend the voice experiences customers already love to healthcare systems, and give care providers new ways to save time and personalize care for their patients.”</p>
