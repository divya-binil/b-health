<p>The governor announced legislation this week that would safeguard access to virtual care after the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-proposal-expand-access-telehealth-all-part-2021-state-state">announced legislation</a> this week that would expand access to telehealth throughout the state. &nbsp;</p><p>The governor's proposal includes broad regulatory and statutory changes to allow for greater flexibility in where and how patient use telehealth,&nbsp;new requirements for insurers regarding telehealth coverage,&nbsp;technology expansions that would further enable virtual care,&nbsp;and professional development and education aimed at facilitating the use of telemedicine among patients and providers. &nbsp;</p><p>"COVID-19 has changed not only the way we live, but the way healthcare providers support their patients, especially in regard to mental health," said Cuomo in a statement. &nbsp;</p><p>"New Yorkers have adapted throughout 2020, but it is time to push telehealth to the next level in New York State and fully integrate it into our existing healthcare system. These proposals will better allocate our healthcare and technological resources for the 21st century," Cuomo continued.</p>
