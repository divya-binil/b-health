Representatives from major tech companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have joined with some of the biggest health insurers and hospitals in an initiative to provide consumers with easier access to their medical information.

Called the CARIN Blue Button API, the data model is a standard for sharing health claims data, which includes tests, doctors’ visits and medical procedures.

The specs have been developed by the CARIN Alliance, a coalition of health and tech companies that was set up to advance “consumer-directed exchange of health information.”

“The CARIN Blue Button draft implementation guide includes more than 240 claim data elements that have been agreed on by multiple regional and national health plans,” said the alliance.
