<p>Authors from Flare Capital discuss why policy matters for health innovation.<br><br>When evaluating new opportunities in any sector it is important to understand non-market influences – the role legislation, regulation, relationships, etc. have on things such as competitive advantage and new entrants - perhaps none more so than in healthcare.</p><p>The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare (CMS) operates as the nation’s largest payer, and the healthcare industry at large is heavily regulated to promote safe and quality care for all.&nbsp;As a result, healthcare policy and market opportunities are inextricably intertwined.</p><p>For healthcare entrepreneurs and investors, having an ear to the ground on healthcare policy disrupters and priorities is valuable for anticipating trends, challenges, and opportunities for healthcare innovation now and in the future.</p>
