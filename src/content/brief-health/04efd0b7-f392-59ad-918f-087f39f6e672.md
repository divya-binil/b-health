  Closing evidence gaps in digital health requires a systematic approach that
  involves several steps. Here are some steps that can be taken to close
  evidence gaps in digital health:  Define the research question: The first step
  is to clearly define the research question, which should be specific and
  relevant to the digital health technology under investigation. The research
  question should also consider the study design, outcome measures, and target
  population.  Identify the evidence gap: The next step is to identify the
  evidence gap by conducting a systematic review of existing literature. This
  will help to determine what evidence exists and what is still missing. The
  review should consider the quality of existing evidence, identify any biases,
  and assess the generalizability of the findings.  Develop a research plan:
  Once the evidence gap has been identified, a research plan should be
  developed. This plan should include a clear hypothesis, study design, sample
  size calculation, data collection methods, and analysis plan. The plan should
  also consider any ethical considerations and potential sources of bias. 
  Conduct the study: The study should be conducted according to the research
  plan. Data should be collected and analyzed using appropriate statistical
  methods. The study should also be conducted in accordance with ethical
  standards and regulatory requirements.  Evaluate the results: Once the study
  is complete, the results should be evaluated. The findings should be compared
  to existing evidence and any differences should be noted. The study should
  also be evaluated for potential biases and limitations.  Disseminate the
  findings: The final step is to disseminate the findings to the relevant
  stakeholders. This includes publishing the results in academic journals,
  presenting at conferences, and communicating the findings to policymakers and
  practitioners.  By following these steps, it is possible to close evidence
  gaps in digital health and generate the knowledge needed to inform practice
  and policy decisions.
