<p>According to a study, the mobile integrated health community paramedicine (MIH-CP) programme at the University of Maryland Medical Center, which sends specially trained paramedics to the homes of chosen patients after hospital discharge, saw improvements in medication adherence and first-fill prescription rates. A new study found that patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) had improved medication adherence thanks to the University of Maryland Medical Center's mobile integrated health community paramedicine (MIH-CP) programme, which was implemented in Baltimore. An MIH-CP programme, which sends specially trained paramedics to the homes of chosen chronic care patients after discharge from a hospital, increased first-fill prescription rates for CHF patients by almost 20%, according to information published in a recent issue of Exploratory Research in Social and Clinical Pharmacy.</p>
