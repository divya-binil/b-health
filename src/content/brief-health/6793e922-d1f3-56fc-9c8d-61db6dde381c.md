<p>This is the second round of layoffs in less than a year. Brightline, a provider of virtual behavioural health services for children, recently announced a second wave of layoffs in less than a year that once again affected 20% of its workers. In November, months after announcing a further $10 million rise, bringing its total Series C funding to $115 million, the California-based company laid off 20% of its workers. We have also decided to reduce our corporate non-member facing team as we continue to grow our team of therapists, psychiatry providers, coaches, and member support agents to enable us to meet the rising demand for our services across the nation, including the hiring of a new chief clinical officer, Dr. Myra Altman. Although extremely painful, this choice was not made lightly and will ultimately help us provide better service.</p>
