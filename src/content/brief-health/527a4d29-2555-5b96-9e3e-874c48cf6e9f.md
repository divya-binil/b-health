<p>With a new administration looking to reshape healthcare policy and additional special enrollment periods already underway, now is the time to ensure Medicare enrollment systems are ready for the unpredictability, and potential opportunities, ahead. While Medicare is the fastest growing segment of the healthcare industry, it is also highly competitive, expensive to operate in, and riddled with complexities and regulations to navigate. Health plans don’t have room to make a misstep when it comes to this process. Luckily, there are a few “no-regret” investments that plans can make that will better prepare them for the changes that are imminent, such as a potential lowering of the Medicare eligibility age, which would open up the market to an influx of new prospects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
