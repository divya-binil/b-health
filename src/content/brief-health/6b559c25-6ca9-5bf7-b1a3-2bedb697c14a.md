<p>Now is a good time for CIOs to look at ways to create a perfect platform that digs into a much more comprehensive array of data.
CIOs can begin to develop – or partner on developing – solutions that sit on top of their essential systems rather than accessing just the clinical data held in their EHR.
This platform can include offering deeper dives into population health management, accurate cost of patient care, CMS and social data, supply chain optimization (especially when we are having issues with the supply chain on a global scale) and, most importantly, insight to bring more efficiencies in your daily hospital operations.
This is an opportunity for CIOs to shine and lead the way in developing a set of tools that can deliver care anywhere, anytime.
Expand the organization's current telemedicine solution or establish a new one to figure out how to bring the platform readily to a patient's house.
The technology is straightforward, but establishing a full-time command center operations that can monitor many patients simultaneously is essential.
Low code offers the potential to facilitate the development of solutions by using a graphical user interface instead of the traditional approach of relying on hand-coded programming, thus requiring little to no coding to build applications and processes.
The employee's home is now an extension of the network environment, and the solutions must be simple to use when they are outside of the organization's campus.</p>
