<p>"We think healthcare is high on the list of experiences that need reinvention," Neil Lindsay, SVP of Amazon Health Services, said in a statement.
Booking an appointment, waiting weeks or even months to be seen, taking time off work, driving to a clinic, finding a parking spot, waiting in the waiting room then the exam room for what is too often a rushed few minutes with a doctor, then making another trip to a pharmacy – we see lots of opportunity to both improve the quality of the experience and give people back valuable time in their days," Neil Lindsay, SVP of Amazon Health Services, said in a statement.
At HIMSS22 earlier this year, One Medical chief network officer John Singerling said the company looks toward other industries, like tech and hospitality, to center consumers in its design and keep wait times low.
"The opportunity to transform healthcare and improve outcomes by combining One Medical’s human-centered and technology-powered model and exceptional team with Amazon’s customer obsession, history of invention and willingness to invest in the long-term is so exciting," Rubin said in a statement.</p>
