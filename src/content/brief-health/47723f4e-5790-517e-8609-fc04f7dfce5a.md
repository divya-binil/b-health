<p>The company offers a technology platform that aims to help primary care practices find gaps in care and manage the health of their patient populations. In a value-based care agreement, Pearl Health, which provides a technology platform for primary care practises, disclosed on Thursday that it had raised $55 million in Series B funding. In addition to the equity raise, the company stated that it also plans to receive a $20 million line of credit. In addition to AlleyCorp and SV Angel, investors Andreessen Horowitz and Viking Global Investors also participated in the round. In September 2021, the company disclosed a $18 million Series A. Peal is a technological platform targeted at doctors who take part in Medicare's ACO REACH model for primary care. To help doctors identify patients who can benefit from further support, such as those who have several chronic diseases or have just been released from the hospital, it offers data visualisations and recommendations.</p>
