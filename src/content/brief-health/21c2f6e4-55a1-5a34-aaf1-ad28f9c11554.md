<ul><li>Women’s health startups are starting to garner&nbsp;a lot of attention. However, a new report out of&nbsp;PitchBook&nbsp;found that the industry is still struggling to catch the attention of VCs, and has produced few exits. “Only six femtech exits were completed in 2019; however, this still represents a 64% increase in exit value compared to 2018. The largest exits in recent years include Progyny’s (NASDAQ: PGNY) $130.0 million IPO and Procter &amp; Gamble’s (NYSE: PG) acquisition of This Is L. for $100.0 million. Progyny’s stock has roughly doubled in the eight months since it went public,” the report reads.&nbsp; Still, the authors of the report said that they see Femtech has a “solid growth outlook,” since there's still many unmet needs in women’s health where tech could help.&nbsp; As for funding, the report calculated that in 2019 femtech companies scored $592.1 million. That was down slightly from 2018’s $620.3 million. So far, in 2020, PitchBook recorded 57 deals and $376.2 million in venture dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/femtech-market-has-potential-struggles-score-investor-dollars">Read on mobihealthnews.com</a></li></ul>
