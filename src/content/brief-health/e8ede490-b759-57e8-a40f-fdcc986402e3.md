<p>Dr. Maulik Majmudar, chief medical officer and cofounder of Biofourmis, discusses why healthcare often struggles to address the consumer experience. Patient experience is a well-known concept in healthcare, but according to Dr. Maulik Majmudar, chief medical officer and cofounder of Biofourmis, health institutions probably aren't investing enough in customer preferences. "It's just not the same experience people have with healthcare, right? If you look at what patients are used to in the real world in other parts of their lives around banking, hotel booking, airlines, or grocery shopping - like anything in life," he said. The AI-enabled remote patient monitoring provider Biofourmis recently branched out into the healthcare industry. Majmudar sat down with MobiHealthNews before to the launch of ViVE to talk about why healthcare fails to invest in the patient experience and how health systems may advance without overtaxing already overworked carers.</p>
