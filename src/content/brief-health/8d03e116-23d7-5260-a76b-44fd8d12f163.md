<p>Among the challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic is the unprecedented demand in personal protective equipment that has led to an <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/health-workers-and-hospitals-grapple-millions-counterfeit-n95-masks"><strong>increase in counterfeiting, price gouging and fraud</strong></a>. Falling for these scams can cost hospitals and other providers time and money, while still leaving their need for medical supplies unfulfilled.</p><p>In times of record levels of demand, it is natural that hospitals would do everything possible to procure product. Yet doing this can actually make problems worse by incentivizing other unreliable brokers to get into the marketplace. The best solution is for manufacturers, distributors and providers to work together in addressing product shortages.</p>
