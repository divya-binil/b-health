<p>The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT said it received more than 700 predictions from stakeholders about healthcare outcomes in 2030.<br><br>This past May, the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT asked healthcare stakeholders: What should healthcare look like in 2030, and what should interoperability have enabled by then?
"Health professionals will be able to use best-in-class software applications and services in combination with electronic health records to enhance care delivery and decision-making within clinical workflows," said one theme statement.
For instance, stakeholders said patients should have internet-based access to their past and present data from clinical and administrative sources – which is already possible in some instances.
Health professionals will also spend less time on administrative tasks and more time caring for their patients, hoped some stakeholders, helped along by integrated clinical and administrative process data.
"Public health response and preparedness will be driven by real-time data that allow public health agencies to quickly identify when and where infectious disease outbreaks occur and maintain insights about health system capacity," said one theme statement – likely reflecting on present-day issues with COVID-19 information infrastructure.
"In terms of what’s next, we (obviously) encourage you to keep pushing forward on interoperability because these 2030 outcome statements are what’s at stake," said Posnack</p>
