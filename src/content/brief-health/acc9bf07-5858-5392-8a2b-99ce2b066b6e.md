<p><strong>Virtual health care can reduce exposure and save resources</strong></p><p>Mobile technology has proven invaluable as hospitals strive to cut down on the number of non-critical appointments and in-person visits. Offering virtual health care as a way to schedule routine checkups can help reduce unnecessary exposure as well as preserve resources, such as personal protective equipment (PPE), for more critical visits. Virtual health care is also more inclusive of a remote workforce.</p><p>In some instances, hospitals are even mounting a rugged tablet on an IV pole to allow specialists to interact with patients remotely via video. This novel use of technology makes it easier for all clinicians involved in a patientâ€™s care to participate in rounds and often results in faster care because specialists can conduct multiple consults without traveling between rooms and hospitals.</p>
