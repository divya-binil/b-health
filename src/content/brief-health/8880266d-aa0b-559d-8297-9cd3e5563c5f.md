<p>AI-based medical assistant now has features to accommodate people with sensory impairments, and improvements to address physical and intellectual disabilities are on the way. New capabilities are being introduced by Mediktor, an advanced AI-based medical assistant for triage and pre-diagnosis, to enhance the evaluation process for people with sensory, physical, and intellectual challenges. Enhancing access to adequate levels of care in favour of health equity involves including elements that cater to the individual requirements of more patients. In less than three minutes, patients can analyze their symptoms and be directed to the best degree of care by Mediktor's AI-based medical assistant. Its objective is to provide patients with individualized online advice and guidance at the first sign of symptoms, leading them to the best course of treatment.</p>
