<p>Harnessing clinical information has become imperative in driving continuous improvements in care delivery and the intensive care unit is one area where digital transformations have been made.</p><p>During the "<a href="https://www.himsslearn.org/philips-digital-dialogue-series-%E2%80%93-episode-2-digital-icu-evolution-past-present-and-future">Digital ICU Evolution: Past, Present and Future</a>" webinar on 4 August, A/Prof John Santamaria, ICU director at St Vincent's Hospital and Chris Wise, Clinical Information System manager at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH), shared their hospitals' journey in digitising critical care and shared how critical care information systems help improve patient outcomes.</p><p>Private ICUs cannot easily go digital, due to perceived costs. Santamaria laid out some of the benefits of having a clinical information system (CIS) to help convince healthcare institutions to kick-start their digital transformations:</p><ul><li>The electronic medical records in ICUs make it easier for coders to find all diagnostic codes they need for applying for funds.</li><li>A digitised ICU also means expediting patients' transition through intensive care as "[harnessing] more information cuts down their length of stay".</li><li>Features of medical and billing systems can also be integrated into a CIS.</li></ul>
