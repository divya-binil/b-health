<p>We strongly believe that only digital health can bring healthcare into the 21st century and make patients the point-of-care.</p><p>Science fiction movies are <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/the-coolest-medical-robots-in-sci-fi-movies/">filled with depictions of medical robots</a> as integral parts of the healthcare system. From Anakin Skywalker’s surgery by autonomous robots to Big Hero 6’s healthcare robot Baymax, these mechanical staffers stayed only within the realm of sci-fi movies and one’s imagination for a long time; but not for much longer. Indeed, as we exemplify in this article, they are steadily making their way into healthcare institutions. The healthcare industry is betting on those potentials as well, with the global medical robot expenditures expected to <a href="https://www.zionmarketresearch.com/report/medical-robot-market">rise by about 20% by 2025</a> to reach $24.6 billion.&nbsp;</p>
