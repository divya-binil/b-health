<p>Patient flow obstacles can contribute significantly to nurse, physician, and other provider stress in four key areas.<br><br>There has been frequent reporting about the problem of provider workforce shortages within hospitals and health systems and the related burnout experienced when working in high-stress situations during the Covid-19 pandemic. There are pre-existing and contributing patient flow challenges that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, which can lead to burnout, and therefore are worth discussing.</p><p><strong>Exposing the Problem</strong></p><p>The extent of provider burnout over the course of the pandemic is well documented. In February 2022, for example, results from a nurse survey commissioned by a prominent staffing firm showed <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220210005146/en/IntelyCare-Research-Group-Nurses-Are-Beyond-Burnout-Suffering-From-PTSD-as-Spiraling-Work-Demands-Force-Them-to-Sacrifice-Their-Mental-Well-Being">56% of nurses</a> reported that their mental health and well-being has suffered due to the pandemic, and 41% are considering leaving the profession for good. Also, the American Nurses Association <a href="https://www.nursingworld.org/news/news-releases/2021/ana-calls-on-congress-and-the-administration-to--investigate-and-mitigate-the-root-causes-of-nurse-shortages/">released a statement</a> calling on President Biden and Congress to address the burnout issue, urging that more needs to be done “<i>to effectively investigate and mitigate the root causes of nursing shortages, and improve working conditions</i>.”</p><p>Widespread burnout and disengagement among providers was simmering even before Covid-19, according to a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2775923">study</a> published by <i>JAMA Network Open</i> in 2021. Although released after the pandemic began, the study examines nurses’ responses to a survey fielded in 2018 that included questions about burnout. Researchers found that nurses who reported leaving or were considering leaving their job mostly attributed their decision to burnout, a stressful work environment, lack of effective leadership, and inadequate staffing.</p>
