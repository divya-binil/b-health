<p>Dr. Jonathan Bushman, one of the three providers, previously worked for a health system, using an EHR designed to support fee-for-service billing and engineered around serving patients through a transactional delivery model.
"Being held captive by this system, I felt I had lost the ability to focus on the patient and earn patient trust, and the challenges caused by the EHR made my day-to-day activities of caring for patients feel more like a chore," he recalled.
When Bushman transitioned to the DPC model, he knew he wanted an EHR that was built to support the clinical care he provides to patients, not coding and billing.
He also wanted an EHR that was easy to use and felt natural with his primary care workflow.
"With Elation, creating clinical documentation; keeping careful patient records; managing tasks, results and messages; and collaborating with other physicians are as easy as they need to be, and the visual experience is uncluttered with a sleek and simple design," he described.
"I am able to capture all the important information about my patients in an easy-to-read clinical profile, swiftly review the chronological record for my patients, see all items requiring action, and quickly document an accurate and meaningful patient story and encounter note – all in a simple three-panel view that gives me complete situational awareness of all the clinically relevant information about each patient," he said.
"Using Elation's EHR, I have the ability to extrapolate the data I want that makes a difference to my patients," he explained.
"Look for an EHR that maximizes clinical context for each patient, makes documentation easy – helpful even – and produces a useful encounter note.
"It should be easy to manage the patient relationship through secure communications and refer patients outside your practice, sharing pertinent information between collaborators in a patient's care journey.
The legacy I hope I can leave is a practice that centers my patients, thanks to the DPC model and an EHR that enables, rather than erodes, the care experience."</p>
