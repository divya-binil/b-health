<p>Patients’ overall health continues to suffer due to the pandemic, with the majority of primary care physicians reporting that their patients' mental health has declined during the past eight months.</p><p>Over a third (37%) of primary care physicians&nbsp;say their patients with chronic conditions are in “noticeably worse health resulting from the pandemic.” This is due, in part, to visits that are not happening: 56% of surveyed clinicians have seen an increase in negative health burdens due to delayed or inaccessible care,&nbsp;according to a <a href="https://www.pcpcc.org/2020/11/14/primary-care-covid-19-week-22-survey"><strong>survey</strong></a> of clinicians conducted in mid-October, seven months into the pandemic.</p><p>The results of the survey were released by the Larry A. Green Center, a research organization, in collaboration with the Primary Care Collaborative (PCC) and 3rd Conversation.</p>
