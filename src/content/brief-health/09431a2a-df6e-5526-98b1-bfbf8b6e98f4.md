<p>According to a report from Milbank Memorial Fund, a Secretary's council would get continued support from an Office of Primary Care, which would promote primary care on the HHS agenda. By collaborating with other government offices and departments as well as other HHS agencies and offices, the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services hopes to improve primary care. According to a recent report from the Milbank Memorial Fund, for this initiative to be effective, congressional support for the establishment of a strong Office of Primary Care with dedicated budget and manpower is necessary. The HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) issued a request for information in June 2022 asking for feedback from the general public on innovations, models, ways to overcome obstacles.</p>
