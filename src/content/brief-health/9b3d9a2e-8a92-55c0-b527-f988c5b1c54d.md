<p>WebCareHealth CEO Dr. Teresa Sieck unpacks the results of the report about remote patient monitoring's abilities to find gaps in care, improve patient engagement, enhance the provider experience and boost revenue.<br><br>Further, 66% of survey respondents at provider organizations say RPM helps identify gaps in care for 10% of patients.
There also is a need for improved RPM ease of use and integration into clinical workflows to help practices effectively care for more patients without adding burdens to providers.
Q. Sixty-six percent of C-suite and clinical leader respondents at all types of provider organizations say RPM helps identify gaps in care for 10% of patients.
A. According to our study, RPM is primarily used to identify gaps in care for high-acuity patients diagnosed with heart failure, hypertension, diabetes and atrial fibrillation.
Through RPM comprehensive real-time data collection, providers can treat immediate needs and proactively monitor trends for patients with chronic conditions.
Providers will need to evaluate the overall impact RPM has on the current state of a patient's health and impact on outcomes over time.
RPM adoption as a new standard of care requires true alignment on patient and provider needs:
A. I was surprised to see that most providers feel RPM is identifying the right gaps in care.
RPM also can identify guideline-directed medical therapies, procedures and tests that help monitor long-term trends to enhance patient care and capture additional revenue.</p>
