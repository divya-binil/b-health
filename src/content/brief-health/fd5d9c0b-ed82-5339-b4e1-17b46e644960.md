<p>The two most pressing challenges in health tech are privacy and the integration of AI, said Micky Tripathi the national coordinator for health IT at HHS. Mr. Tripathi spoke to <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/future-pulse/2022/04/27/reports-of-the-fax-machines-death-are-greatly-exaggerated-00027923"><i>Politico</i></a> about the challenges ahead for integrating more technology into the U.S. healthcare system in an interview published April 27.</p><p>Here are the challenges he highlighted in the interview:</p><ul><li>As more information goes into the hands of patients, it becomes less protected. Hospitals and physicians are HIPAA-protected entities, but when the data leaves, it is no longer protected by HIPAA.<br><br>&nbsp;</li><li>AI is still in its early stages and there's a lot of "black box-edness" to the world of algorithms. This is causing clinicians to be confused about where and why this tech is delivering these results, leading to hesitancy around implementing these applications.</li></ul><p>Despite his concerns, Mr. Tripathi expressed that there is a huge opportunity for the applications of AI in healthcare that would allow a much more tailored experience for patients that could lead to better and more efficient care.</p>
