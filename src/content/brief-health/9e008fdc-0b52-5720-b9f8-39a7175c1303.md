<p>Ida Tin, cofounder and chairwoman at Clue, explains how she sees the fall of Silicon Valley Bank affecting femtech investments and how the sector could progress fruitfully. Although investments in female-focused businesses have increased over the past ten years, they are still small compared to those made in the overall digital health industry. Ida Tin, cofounder and chairwoman of Clue, a menstrual health app with headquarters in Berlin, introduced the term "femtech" in 2016 and joined MobiHealthNews to talk about funding and development in the field. MobiHealthNews: What impact do you anticipate Silicon Valley Bank's failure will have on the femtech industry? Itza Tin I believe there is something generally applicable to be said about innovation, particularly in regards to businesses that may be greater risk but have attracted investments and possibly extremely hard-earned capital. And I would add that I believe it is somewhat similar to how women are always affected first and hardest in conflict zones and catastrophe situations.&nbsp;</p>
