<p>If you know anything about the <a href="https://www.mgma.com/">MGMA</a> organization, they’re probably most well known for all the data they have around medical practices.&nbsp; Whether you’re looking for Provider Compensation Data, Medical Practice Claims and A/R data, or basically any data needed about medical practices, MGMA is the place to go.&nbsp; Given this, it was no surprise that MGMA would come out with their “<a href="https://www.mgma.com/data/landing-pages/mgma-datadive-overview">Quantifying COVID-19: Measuring the Pandemic’s Impact on Medical Practices</a>” report.&nbsp; The report is available as part of their MGMA DataDrive for those interested in purchasing the full report.</p><p>We got a look at the report and wanted to share some of the highlights.&nbsp; In fact, MGMA did a recent <a href="https://www.mgma.com/resources/operations-management/6-keys-to-medical-practices%E2%80%99-recovery-amid-covid-1">webinar</a> sharing insights from the report and here were 6 key takeaways from the presentation:</p><p>1. Patients came back for care in summer 2020 after safety worries, deferred visits</p><p>2. The recovery was short-lived due to the fall 2020 COVID-19 surge</p><p>3. Telehealth surged, then ebbed, then grew again with new waves of COVID-19</p><p>4. Slow periods for productivity were opportunities to catch up on collections</p><p>5. Supply costs were up dramatically, but cuts elsewhere lowered overall spending</p><p>6. Staffing struggles persist due to quarantine, childcare and a tight labor market</p>
