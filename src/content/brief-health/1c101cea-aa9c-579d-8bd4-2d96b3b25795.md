The following are several patient comments about the care provided by Anna.</p><p>Anna is caring, compassionate and knowledgeable.”</p><p>“Anna was absolutely amazing, She explained everything to me with care and compassion.”</p><p>“Anna spoke to me as a person and not just as another patient.”</p><p>“Anna was gentle and made me feel at ease.”</p><p>“She is sweet and nonjudgmental.”</p><p>Anna puts herself in her patients’ shoes. “The hospital is a scary place for patients.
