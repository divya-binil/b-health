      IBMers believe in progress that the application of intelligence, reason
      and science can improve business, society and the human condition. IBM’s
      greatest asset is the IBMer. We believe our strength lies in the diversity
      of our employees. IBM encourages creative pursuits and passions outside of
      work, because when IBMers can explore their curiosity, it gives all of us
      a new outlook on the world and its possibilities for emerging tech.
      Together, IBM can drive progress through meaningful innovation and action.

<p>IBM on Friday announced a deal with Bay Area-based Francisco Partners to sell off healthcare data and analytics assets from its Watson Health business.
With the acquisition, Francisco Partners will acquire "extensive and diverse" datasets and technology products amassed and built by IBM and its various healthcare acquisitions over the years, such as Clinical Development, Health Insights, MarketScan, Micromedex, Social Program Management and other imaging and radiology tools.
And over the past decade, IBM has spent billions scooping up businesses – Merge Healthcare, Phytel, Explorsys, Truven Health Analytics and others – to build out the Watson Health portfolio.
"Today's agreement with Francisco Partners is a clear next step as IBM becomes even more focused on our platform-based hybrid cloud and AI strategy," said Tom Rosamilia, senior vice president of IBM Software.
"IBM remains committed to Watson, our broader AI business, and to the clients and partners we support in healthcare IT," he added.
"Through this transaction, Francisco Partners acquires data and analytics assets that will benefit from the enhanced investment and expertise of a healthcare industry focused portfolio."</p>
