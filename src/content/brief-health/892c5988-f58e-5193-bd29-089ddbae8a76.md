<p>UpStream Healthcare raised $140 million in Series B funding to enhance its technology and services for value-based primary care practises. Coatue and Dragoneer co-led the round, which also included Avidity Partners, Define Ventures, and Mubadala as investors. The startup's overall capital pile now stands at close to $185 million after the Series B. A $45 million Series A investment was originally announced by UpStream for November 2021. Practices who engage with patients on Medicare and Medicare Use plans can take advantage of UpStream's technological platform and clinical support. The start-up offers embedded clinical support teams, such as pharmacists or care coordination nurses, that can help primary care practises. Off-site teams are also available to help practises or patients after hours.</p>
