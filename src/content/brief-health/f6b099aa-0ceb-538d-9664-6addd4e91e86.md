<p>Japanese medical device maker Jolly Good and the Pain Center at the Aichi Medical University Hospital will conduct a study on the efficacy of virtual reality-based therapy for chronic pain.
In a press statement, the companies said they will conduct "multifaceted research on the use of VR in diverse situationsâ€¦ to develop VR therapy for chronic pain".
The first phase of their research involves looking into the development of rehabilitation therapy using VR, targeting people with complex regional pain syndrome, post-stroke pain, and other pain-induced conditions.
Last month, the VR DTx maker received a de novo clearance from the Food and Drugs Administration to sell its product for treating chronic lower back pain.</p>
