<p>According to a new study from the University of Maryland and published in the December 2022 issue of Exploratory Research in Social and Clinical Pharmacy, patients with chronic heart disease and lung disease are more likely to fill their prescriptions when enrolled in a Mobile Integrated Healthcare and Community Paramedicine (MIH-CP) programme after hospital discharge. In order to decrease hospital readmissions, enhance care coordination, and speed up 911 response times, MIH-CP programmes send specially trained paramedics to visit patients in their homes in conjunction with other healthcare professionals. Within the first 30 days of enrolment, the first-fill rates of prescriptions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) each climbed by approximately 20% and 25%, respectively. The six-month pilot also saw an 8% increase in drug adherence.</p>
