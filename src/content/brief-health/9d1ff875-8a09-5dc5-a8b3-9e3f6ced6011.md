<p>The United States Department of Health and Human Services has referred to this area of medicine as the "next evolution of medical treatments" because it focuses on finding ways to regrow, repair, or replace harmed or sick cells, organs, or tissues. The Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine is where regenerative medicine is housed at Wake Forest University School of Medicine (WFIRM). Medical professionals and researchers at WFIRM were the first in the world to design successfully implanted organs made in a lab. It is acknowledged as a global leader in converting scientific research into therapeutic therapies as a result of ongoing improvements, significant grants, and collaborations with top organisations throughout the globe.</p>
