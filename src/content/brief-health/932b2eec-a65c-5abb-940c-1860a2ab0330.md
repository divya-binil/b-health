<p>Interoperability, organ donation technologies, public health reporting of infectious diseases, the caregiver experience, care coordination and risk arrangements, and data usability – these are the subjects and technologies that Cerner will emphasize at HIMSS22, according to Sam Lambson, vice president of interoperability at Cerner.
We'll also highlight other new solutions to help automate our clients' environments – for example, streamlining organ donation and transplant notifications through our collaboration with Transplant Connect.
The solution automates a previously burdensome reporting process, enabling caregivers more time to deliver patient care.
A. Cerner's overarching theme at HIMSS focuses on enhancing patient care and the caregiver experience, ultimately helping to improve health outcomes across our global community.
As a long-time advocate for interoperability standards, we're not only making information securely available in unprecedented ways for our clients and their affiliates, but we are helping our clients take advantage of these new capabilities in outside systems – automating previously cumbersome or manual processes.
Bringing together external and internal patient data into a single longitudinal patient record and presenting in a simplified workflow can reduce the burden on caregivers while providing a holistic view of each patient's care history.
Plus, having access to comprehensive and easy-to-understand data can help reduce EHR-related burnout and enable caregivers to spend more time providing informed patient care.</p>
