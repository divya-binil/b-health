<p>An opportunity to transition from a system built to treat the sick to one that is defined by each person's health is presented by the digitalization of healthcare. To properly take advantage of this potential, we must go beyond simply providing better treatment for those who have excellent insurance, the option to self-pay, or who are utilising the finest data-consumption apps on their high-end cellphones.</p><p>As a sector, we excel at recognising the issues with health inequities but fall short when it comes to solving them. Many of us had hope that we could finally have the momentum for significant and long-lasting change because of the horror of the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on underrepresented communities and the strength of the Black &nbsp;Lives Matter movement.</p>
