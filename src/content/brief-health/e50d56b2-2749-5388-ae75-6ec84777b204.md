<p>AI research has taken a step forward, turning a smart algorithm into a tool for the early detection of diseases.
Together with a European software developer, the company has implemented an AI platform that can process DICOM images (MRI, CT, X-ray, and PET) and non-graphic data.
A cloud-based AI tool collects and analyzes data obtained from research (medical scans, EHRs, IoT devices, genomic storage) and predicts the possibility of a person developing neurological diseases (Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and so on).
The AI ​​platform performs up to a hundred tests per minute, providing doctors with accurate results.
Harvard Medical School has developed an AI-powered chatbot that communicates with patients and makes diagnoses.
After analyzing the health state of a person, a smart algorithm names the suspected disease and its causes.
</p><p>Freenome, a multiomics AI healthcare platform, has taken a step toward preventive medicine with innovative tests for the early detection of colorectal cancer. VirtuSense is a set of AI tools and sensors that can predict fall-risk in old people.
The company’s product, VSTBalance, uses a smart algorithm to identify a person’s lack of balance, lack of coordination, and predict the probability of a fall in the coming year with percentage accuracy.
Accordingly, an increasing number of patients need help and supervision in the treatment of this disease.
One Drop offered an AI solution combined with additional equipment (glucometer, test strip plan) and personal consultations.
As a result of research, One Drop found that in just 2 months of using the platform, patients with type 2 diabetes reduced A1C by 1.9%.
According to surgeons working with smart machines, patients experience less pain due to smaller incisions.
AI-based healthcare apps prove this.
Smart algorithms detect dangerous diseases faster than doctors and traditional diagnostic methods.</p>
