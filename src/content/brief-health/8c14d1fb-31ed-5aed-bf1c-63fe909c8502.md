<p>As the healthcare system becomes more complex, payers, health systems, and providers are increasingly recognizing the important role that Health Information Organizations (HIOs) play in health data exchange – leading to more coordinated care, improved clinical outcomes, and reduction in the total cost of care.
Audacious Inquiry has partnered with HIOs across more than a dozen states for over a decade to develop successful and sustainable revenue models for health data exchanges at both the federal and state level.
In the white paper “Improving Patient Outcomes and Driving Revenue in a New Era of Value-Based Care,” the company shares insight into the current state of HIO funding, how HIOs are driving value-based care, and successful examples of revenue models that support long-term HIO sustainability.
HIOs provide managed care organizations with access to rich patient data sets and real-time information that support value-based care success.
In an industry rife with barriers to patient data exchange, HIOs represent one of the few levers available to healthcare stakeholders looking to proactively drive targeted care interventions that support population health objectives.</p>
