<p>Nuralogix has added additional capacity to detect fatty liver disease using Transdermal Optical Imaging technology and AI models. Utilising its contactless health platform, which analyses vital signs and offers health risk assessments, NuraLogix has unveiled new capacity for determining the likelihood of developing fatty liver disease. The company's researchers have created artificial intelligence (AI) models that use facial blood patterns to forecast a person's likelihood of getting fatty liver disease (FLD). According to Dr. Keith Thompson, chief medical officer at NuraLogix, "many people with this condition are unaware of it and drift further into metabolic complications." This study demonstrates the platform's ability to screen for FLD and assist users in making the necessary lifestyle adjustments to avoid a "waterfall" event like liver failure. With any video-enabled device, the NuraLogix Anura contactless health platform can already take more than 30 medical-grade health vitals, including blood pressure.</p>
