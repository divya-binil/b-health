<p>Having designated two of its four hospitals as dedicated COVID-19 facilities in 2020, the private healthcare brand had a lot to focus on. But Medcare’s leadership recognised the importance of continuing its digital transformation journey through a critical time. The premium medical care company – part of parent group Aster DM Healthcare – reportedly treats over 1.2 million patients across 35 specialties every year.
“We had been on this digital journey much before COVID, but it [was at] a slow pace,” reveals Medcare Group CEO, Dr Shanila Laiju.
“We wanted to understand how to reach our patients – we wanted to make sure that our patients are taken care of, and their needs are met.”
To avoid setbacks with the adoption and implementation of Medcare’s EMR, it was important to involve clinicians from the start, he says.
</p><p>For Medcare, it’s important that these advantages are realised by patients.
“Patient-centred care starts right at the first interaction of the patient with Medcare.
That's the most important thing for us,” says Dr Rahul Deshmukh, Medical Director at Medcare Orthopaedic &amp; Spine Hospital.
Touching upon the advantages of digital transformation, he lists 24/7 accessibility, continuity of care, and patient safety.
As long as patients remain safe, the industry works.”
There’s already a strategy set in stone for the next few years for Medcare’s four hospitals – Medcare Hospital Al Safa, Medcare Hospital Sharjah, Medcare Women &amp; Children Hospital, and Medcare Orthopaedics &amp; Spine Hospital in Dubai – and its medical centres, Laiju confirms.
I think there’s a lot of investment that’s going to go into digital technology and innovation.”
But that’s how technology is going to make a big difference in making healthcare affordable, accessible, [and] ensuring that the patient experience is top class.”</p>
