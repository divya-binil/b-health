<p>Andrea Palm, deputy secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, says the agency is striving to "put the people we serve at the center of what we do." Meanwhile, ONC officials offer updates on new Cures Act rules. Officials from the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT provided some updates on how the organisations are collaborating with others to help create a "digital healthcare system of the future" that works for everyone during a discussion at HIMSS23 this past week in Chicago. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is adapting its strategy to better serve consumers through increased cross-departmental and interdepartmental cooperation, according to Andrea Palm, deputy secretary. "The work that we do really needs to leverage the various parts of the department to put the people that we serve at the centre of what we do," she said.</p>
