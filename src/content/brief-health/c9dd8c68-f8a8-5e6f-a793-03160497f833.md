Pediatric health system Akron (Ohio) Children's Hospital is partnering with healthcare data and analytics company Health Catalyst to provide analytics for decision-making to its two hospitals and 54 care locations. Fort Myers, Fla.-based Lee Health partnered with telehealth and remote patient monitoring Health Recovery Solutions to create a virtual health program for patients with congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and post cardio-thoracic surgery patients.</p>
