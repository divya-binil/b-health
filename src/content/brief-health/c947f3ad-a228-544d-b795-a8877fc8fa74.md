<p>The COVID-19 pandemic pushed the business from delicate conditions like sexual health and hair loss into primary care and mental health.</p><p>Hims &amp; Hers has grown rapidly across both of its lines – for men and for women – supporting care for many conditions that patients often feel uncomfortable talking about, including sexual health, mental health, contraception and hair loss.
Melissa Baird, COO at Hims &amp; Hers, leads a team of engineers that designed a telehealth experience that engages and connects patient care across its service lines, especially for stigmatized conditions.
Early in the pandemic, the company launched mental health and primary care service lines.
It was then we recognized that we wanted to do something that helped in a real way – providing high-quality digital health services via real, seasoned medical professionals as well as affordable and effective products that are backed by science.</p>
