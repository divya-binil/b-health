<p>The tool, which is based on shipments reported by the distributor, currently only displays information from 22 states.<br><br>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has launched a treatment locator to help patients and providers find monoclonal antibody therapeutics for COVID-19.</p><p>Housed at HHS' <a href="https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/therapeutics-distribution#distribution-locations">Protect Public Data Hub</a>, the tool displays locations that have received shipments of therapeutics under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authority within the past several weeks. &nbsp;</p><p>As of Monday, the locator displayed data from only 22 states. HHS notes that states must opt in to have facility information displayed, and that it would not display locations that received fewer than five courses of treatment.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>"The therapeutics have been allocated to all states and U.S. territories," explained an HHS spokesperson to <i>Healthcare IT News.&nbsp;</i>The spokesperson&nbsp;noted that more states have since opted in and that their information will show in the system soon. &nbsp;</p><p>"This locator allows patients and providers to find sites for outpatient treatment options, which may help reduce the number of people who require hospitalization for COVID-19 care, which in turn reduces the strain on our nation’s hospitals and their staff," said Dr. Robert Kadlec, the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, in a statement.</p>
