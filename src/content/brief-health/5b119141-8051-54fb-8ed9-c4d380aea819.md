<p>A recent <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgab859/6445182?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false">study</a> from Stanford found that pediatric patients with rapid access to continuous glucose monitoring soon after a <a href="https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=understanding-type-1-diabetes-138-V1042">type 1 diabetes</a> diagnosis had healthier blood sugar values than an earlier group of patients who werenâ€™t given the monitors near the time of diagnosis.&nbsp;</p><p>The research provides an example of how the healthcare industry is evolving to use technology: It provides more frequent touchpoints with caregivers, makes quality care available to a larger number of patients, and gives patients of all ages the opportunity to drive their own care.</p><p>Specifically, at six months and 12 months after diagnosis, the patients in the new cohort (the group given access to the technology right after diagnosis) had significantly lower and healthier HbA1c levels than the earlier cohort (who received access much later).</p><p>The findings show that early access to diabetes technology, combined with structured education and support, leads to positive results for children and adolescent patients. Any time we can use technology to improve outcomes, it is considered a win. However, I believe these findings are much bigger and more impactful from a holistic care perspective.&nbsp;</p>
