<p>A critical part of the benchmark development work will involve analysis of findings from a self-assessment cybersecurity maturity survey that medical device vendors are invited to take online. But an organization's previous or current use of the Joint Security Plan is not a requirement for participation in the self-assessment survey, Su√°rez says. That's a best practice that many companies can implement within their own R&amp;D organizations so that they are producing more secure software and code.&nbsp;</p>
