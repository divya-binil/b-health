<p>Most of us remember the “old” days when people still communicated through handwritten letters. Checking the mailbox in the hopes of finding something addressed to you was an eagerly anticipated part of daily life. Though you can still pen a letter to someone and send it with a stamp, typically the only items people dig out of their mailboxes these days are much less satisfying bills and spam mail.</p><p>Now, snail mail has largely been replaced by more sophisticated forms of communication influenced by progress, technology, and the ever-present need for speed and convenience. For most consumers, businesses, and organizations, if it isn’t fast, reliable, and easy to use, they don’t want it—and they certainly won’t use it. We live in an era of smartphones, status updates, texting, tweeting, and TikTok. Rather than measure the time to connect with someone in weeks or days, today it’s in hours, minutes, or even seconds. Nearly <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/future-of-customer-experience.html">80 percent</a> of American consumers say that speed and convenience are the most important elements of a positive customer experience.</p>
