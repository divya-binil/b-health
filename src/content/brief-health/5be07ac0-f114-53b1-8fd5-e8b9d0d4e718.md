<p>After I published my article last month suggesting that the <a href="https://www.healthcareittoday.com/2021/03/04/the-most-influential-person-in-healthcare-might-soon-be-the-care-manager-not-the-doctor/">Care Manager might be becoming the most influential person in healthcare</a>, the Chief Medical Officer at my company <a href="https://carecognitics.com/">CareCognitics</a>, Spencer Kubo, asked me if he could expand the discussion and share the importance of the role doctors play in chronic care management as well.</p><p>Before I share his thoughts and perspectives as a doctor, I thought I’d first acknowledge that my previous headline was a bit click baity in nature.&nbsp; At the end of the day, it’s not really a competition between doctors and care managers and it doesn’t matter which one is <i>more influential</i>.&nbsp; The reality, as Spencer Kubo describes below and I say at the end of my last article, is that healthcare is a team sport and each player has their strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp; The point of my previous article was to highlight the rising importance of the care manager in healthcare and wasn’t meant as a commentary on the importance of doctors.&nbsp; We’re going to need everyone on board to improve healthcare and doctors play and will continue to play an important role.</p><p><i>Now, here’s some thoughts from Spencer Kubo, Chief Medical Officer at </i><a href="https://carecognitics.com/"><i>CareCognitics</i></a><i>, on the role and importance of physicians in chronic care management:</i></p><p>Sunny Tara’s article was insightful, provocative and visionary.&nbsp; Certainly, the growing role of the care manager is transforming medical care and facilitating the transition to value based systems.&nbsp; The points about scale (# doctors/# patients), cost effectiveness and relationship building are spot on.</p>
