<p>Throughout our series, we’ve talked about our approach to Digital in healthcare, as well as specific products we’ve built to serve our patients. What we’ve described, which encompasses the work of over three years for the Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH) Digital team, has been focused on the key theme of growing PSJH through better access, convenience, and personalization.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geekwire.com/sponsor-post/express-care-10x-better-experience-healthcare/">Express Care</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geekwire.com/sponsor-post/patient-engagement-personalized-consumer-health/">Circle</a>, and our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geekwire.com/sponsor-post/companies-shouldnt-exist-jobs-right/">digital marketing</a>&nbsp;efforts have all been aimed at providing patients with access to alternative modalities of care and personalized experiences delivered to patients. In markets where these products have been deployed, we’ve seen growth in bringing in new patients or retaining existing ones, thereby growing our footprint. Our work on access, convenience, and personalization will continue through ongoing development of products to create frictionless patient experiences and personalized platforms.</p><p>This year, we’ve embarked upon 5 additional digital journeys, for a total of six digital journeys in addition to our focus on access and personalization, which seek to address a broader set of strategic problems for different patient populations. Each of the journeys represents a 5–10 year path we’ll be traveling to digitally transform our organization across key themes. Our Six Digital Journeys are:</p><p>Access and Personalization (covered in prior posts)</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simplifying Care</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make Caregiving Easier</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Better Serve Medicaid</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Power Behavioral Health</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Enable New Revenue Streams</p>
