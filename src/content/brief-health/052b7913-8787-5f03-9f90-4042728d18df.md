<p>On Aug. 4, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra declared the ongoing spread of monkeypox virus in the U.S. a public health emergency - the FDA is working to get vaccines to affected communities.
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra announced on Aug. 4 that he will declare the ongoing spread of monkeypox virus in the United States a Public Health Emergency (PHE).
A press release from HHS states that “This action will further strengthen and accelerate the Biden-Harris Administration’s response in recognition of the continued rapid transmission of monkeypox in the U.S. and globally, and to signal the seriousness and urgency with which the Administration is responding." &nbsp;The announcement comes on the heels of President Biden appointing Robert Fenton of the Federal Emergency Management Agency as White House National Monkeypox Response Coordinator and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as White House National Monkeypox Response Deputy Coordinator.”</p>
