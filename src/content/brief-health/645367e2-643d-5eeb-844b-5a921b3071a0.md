<p>&nbsp;<br>With the United Kingdom (UK) leaving the European Union (EU), changes came into force for manufacturers placing products on the UK market. As of January 1, 2021, a new conformity assessment marking scheme - called UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) marking - was launched in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) in place of the CE mark. DEKRA is committed to continue its services to customers, for example manufacturers of ATEX and medical devices related products, active in the UK and has started the process to become a UK Approved Body.</p><p>DEKRA is in the process to become a UK Approved Body with the National Accreditation Body of the UK (UKAS) for ATEX certification and for medical device certification (designation by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, MHRA). DEKRA is developing a UKCA conformity assessment process which will be delivered from DEKRAâ€™s newly established UK legal entity.</p><p>DEKRA is committed to supporting its customers with the implementation of UKCA marking and currently has partner agreements in place to offer solutions for products certified according to the Equipment for Potentially Explosive Atmospheres (ATEX), Radio Equipment (RED), Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC), Low Voltage (LVD), Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), Outdoor Noise (OND) and Machinery Directives. The solutions are already available as these products need to have a UKCA certificate as of January 1, 2022.</p><p>From January 1, 2021 to July 1, 2023 onwards the CE marking will still be recognized by the UK for medical products. As of July 2023, however, manufacturers that want to (continue to) place their products on the UK market need to comply with the new UKCA marking regulation. DEKRA will be able to support its customers with these new services after designation by UKAS (the National Accreditation Body of the UK) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</p><p>For more information and updates about UKCA marking and our process in becoming a UK Approved Body, please visit <a href="https://www.dekra-product-safety.com/en/ukca-marking-services">https://www.dekra-product-safety.com/en/ukca-marking-services</a></p><p><strong>Media contacts</strong><br>Natalie Byrne<br>DEKRA Certification UK Limited<br>Phone: +44 2380 760722&nbsp;<br>Email: Natalie.Byrne@dekra.com</p><p>Anne van Vlaenderen<br>DEKRA Certification B.V.<br>Phone: +31 88 96 83323&nbsp;<br>Email: Anne.vanVlaenderen@dekra.com</p>
