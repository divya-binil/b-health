<p>IBM in healthcare: from DeepMind to Watson, this tech giant is still in the game of transforming healthcare for the better.<br><br>Back in 2015, IBM’s previous CEO, <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article212325914.html">Virginia Rometty famously said</a> that IBM’s “<i>moon shot will be the impact we have on healthcare</i>.” Under the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson-health">Watson Health</a> banner, the tech company has been leveraging its expertise in cognitive computing to assist medical decision-making. In its wake, Watson Health attracted several partners and made a series of acquisitions to forge ahead of its vision.</p><p>But in recent years, the tech giant’s moonshot ambition seems to have waned. It faced management issues and had to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/robotics/artificial-intelligence/layoffs-at-watson-health-reveal-ibms-problem-with-ai">lay off part of its Watson Health workforce in 2018</a>. After four years of working on a mission “to eradicate cancer” that <a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/ibm-watson-layoffs-is-healthcare-ai-ready-for-prime-time-/">cost over $62 million</a>, the MD Anderson Cancer Center <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2017/02/19/md-anderson-benches-ibm-watson-in-setback-for-artificial-intelligence-in-medicine/#5a1c7aad3774">severed ties</a> with IBM Watson. In fact, over a dozen of its clients and partners <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-bet-billions-that-watson-could-improve-cancer-treatment-it-hasnt-worked-1533961147">stopped or diminished their projects</a>. The health A.I. branch also received wide criticism <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/ibm-responds-recent-watson-media-coverage">following reports</a> that questioned its diagnostic prowess while pointing out potential risks to patients’ safety.</p><p>Nevertheless, IBM still has some interest in the healthcare industry but recent developments indicate a change in trajectory in this field. Let’s look at those recent developments coming from IBM.</p>
