<p>Meg Barron, the AMA's vice president of digital health strategy, said during a recent AMA Telehealth Immersion Program webinar that there has never been a greater need to be able to use digital solutions and technologies to help really meet the need of helping to ensure that the patient-physician relationship is as strong as it can be.
