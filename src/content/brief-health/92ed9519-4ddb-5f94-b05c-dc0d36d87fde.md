<p>The EHR giant will integrate Google Health search and summarization technology to enable care teams to find information faster in the longitudinal health record.<br><br>The combined technology will enable the use of Google Health's search and summarization capabilities within the Expanse EHR with the aim of helping clinicians provide the best care through quick and easy access to information from multiple sources with a longitudinal view of a patient's health history.
Meditech and Google Health said they are confident their combined effort will fill these gaps by pulling forward discrete information from legacy and disparate systems.
To enable this search and summary functionality, Meditech will use Google Health's tools to create a longitudinal health data layer, which will unite data from different sources and harmonize it into a standard FHIR format designed for clinician tools.
"Google Health and Meditech have a shared goal of supporting care teams with a complete view of the patient record," said Paul Muret, vice president and general manager of Care Studio at Google Health</p>
