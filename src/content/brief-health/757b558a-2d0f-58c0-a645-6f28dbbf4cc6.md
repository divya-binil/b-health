<p>If you’ve followed Healthcare IT Today and our <a href="https://www.healthcareittoday.com/healthcare-it-today-interviews-podcast/">Health IT Interviews podcast</a>, you know it’s pretty rare that I have the same guest on the show and when I do it’s usually a year or a half dozen years apart.&nbsp; However, when we finished recording the episode “<a href="https://www.healthcareittoday.com/2020/12/22/what-makes-specialty-acute-care-telehealth-different/">What Makes Specialty Acute Care Telehealth Different?</a>” with&nbsp;John Kalix, CEO&nbsp;at <a href="https://www.soctelemed.com/">SOC Telemed</a>, we stumbled upon a topic that I felt deserved another episode.&nbsp; That topic was a look at the various Business Dynamics associated with Specialty Telehealth.</p><p>In this episode we talk about all the business dynamics for a hospital or health system that might be looking at whether they should have a specialists in house and when they should consider using a specialty specific telehealth option.&nbsp; Does the size of the organization matter?&nbsp; Does the “supply” of a certain specialist influence the decision?&nbsp; Are there some specialties that are better for this than others?</p><p>Plus, we also dive into the details around the costs of a telehealth specialist versus one in house.&nbsp; We talk about the cost of locum tenens specialists and those costs as compared with a telehealth specialist.&nbsp; What’s the ROI model to consider?&nbsp; Finally, we talk about the pros and cons of the experience a specialty doctor will have doing telehealth vs in-person.</p>
