<p>The pandemic has changed the way care is delivered, with clinical staff fighting an unknown disease, others being assigned to previously unfamiliar areas, and medical students being involved as workforce. To adapt, clinical educators must change their ways of working and develop new methods of training delivery. The clinical education team at a large London integrated care trust shares their experience of adjusting their training programmes to the new needs (Baldwin et al. 2020).</p>
