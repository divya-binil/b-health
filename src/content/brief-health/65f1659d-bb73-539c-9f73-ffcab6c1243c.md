<p>Now that patient education resources are available in the cloud, healthcare institutions can create their own tailored, individualised care management messages and programmes. Access to Wolters Kluwer, Health content on Azure is also available to virtual care providers and payer care management. In the initial stage of the collaboration, Wolters Kluwer's healthcare information products - UpToDate, Lexicomp, and Emmi, a tool for individualised learning will be included into brand-new programmes like Digital Health Architect. According to the statement, the new content-as-a-service solution (CaaS) platform includes Azure DevOps, Azure Active Directory, and Azure Cosmos DB. From a library of more than 600 movies and 8,500 digital instructional booklets available in the cloud-based Digital Health Architect, healthcare institutions can create their own educational content.</p>
