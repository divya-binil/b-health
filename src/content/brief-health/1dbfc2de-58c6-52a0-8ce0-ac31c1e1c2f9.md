<p>This morning Suki, an artificial intelligence-backed healthcare voice tool, announced a $55 million Series C funding round.
This news comes more than two years after the company closed a $20 million Series C funding round led by Flare Capital Partners.
The company plans to use the new cash to expand its user base and grow the capabilities of Suki Assistant and the Suki Speech Platform.
“We are at a turning point in healthcare, where it’s now imperative to offer technology that improves physician burnout caused by documentation and administrative burden,” Punit Soni, CEO of Suki, said in a statement.
“March was instantly drawn to Suki’s mission to help healthcare organizations lift the administrative burden from doctors so they can focus on taking care of their patients,” Wes Nichols, partner at March Capital, said in a statement.</p>
