<p>HIMSS21 will kick off one week from today&nbsp;in Las Vegas as the first and largest on-site healthcare conference since the start of the&nbsp;COVID-19 pandemic last&nbsp;spring.</p><p>The conference host, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS), announced in May it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.himss.org/global-conference/health-and-safety-hub"><strong>adopted a “vaccination required” approach</strong></a>&nbsp;for all attendees, exhibitors&nbsp;and HIMSS staff for&nbsp;HIMSS21,&nbsp;slated to take place August 9-13 in Las Vegas.&nbsp;</p><p>HIMSS also is offering a <a href="https://www.himss.org/global-conference/digital-about-program"><strong>digital event</strong></a> along with the in-person conference for those who don't want to travel to Las Vegas.</p><p>Worsening COVID conditions have&nbsp;likely impacted registration for the event. According to HIMSS,&nbsp;more than 18,000 people have registered for&nbsp;the digital and in-person experience, with new registrations continuing to roll in. By comparison, HIMSS19 had 43,000 registrants.</p><p>There are 735 companies signed up as exhibitors, about half the usual number.</p><p>While lower attendance will make for less crowded hallways at the conference, the&nbsp;HIMSS conference also will be a testing ground for the return of live in-person events, and at a time when the Delta variant of COVID-19 continues to rage across the country.</p><p>As the conference approaches, the state of Nevada is seeing a surge in cases.</p><p>Only 44% of Nevadans are fully vaccinated. Overall, the Silver State is recording an average of 32.7 new daily cases per 100,000 people—a 22% jump since last week, Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2021/07/30/travel-alert-delta-variant-covid-19-transmission/?sh=4d47d80a1ce0"><strong>reported</strong></a> July 30.</p><p>The highest number of COVID-19 cases is in Clark County, where Las Vegas is located. The Clark County Commission voted last week in an emergency meeting to require face coverings for all employees working indoors, according to Forbes.</p>
