<p>According to a clinical experiment employing software from XRHealth, a company that creates and manages virtual treatment rooms in the metaverse, hot flashes are decreased and a woman with breast or ovarian cancer's general psychological health is improved, according to results published in MDPI. The American Cancer Society projects that 19,880 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2022, and the CDC reports that 264,000 women in the United States alone are diagnosed with breast cancer each year. Hot flashes are a common symptom for female cancer survivors, and they can make it difficult to fall asleep and wake up with night sweats. The study included 42 women with hot flashes who were taking chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or both. The women's ages ranged from 25 to 60.</p>
