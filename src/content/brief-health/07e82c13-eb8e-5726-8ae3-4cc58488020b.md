<p>The health system found the admissions and scheduling teams were having more informed, productive phone conversations as a result of the in-depth answers the chat was able to provide beforehand.<br><br>Aspire Indiana Health, based in Noblesville, prioritizes the patient experience in all of its implemented workflows and systems.</p><p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong></p><p>Before considering a chat solution, the health system had high call volumes, and staff was spending a considerable amount of time consistently answering the same questions. A patient's journey can be complex, and certainly varies, but staff members believe it is their inherent duty to support each unique patient journey to the best of their ability.&nbsp;</p><p>"We took the time to critically think about our current process for handling patient inquiries and found any single patient could be asking questions about programs – recovery services, housing options, primary care, behavioral health services – in a single conversation," said Demetrius Dillard, director of information systems and technology at Aspire Indiana Health.</p>
