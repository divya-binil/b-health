<p>The guide is intended, according to NCCoE, to help identify risks associated with RPM architecture and ensure healthcare organizations are partnering with appropriate telehealth platform providers.
In order to develop the guidance and demonstrate how organizations can enhance resiliency, NCCoE collaborated with industry partners to build a laboratory environment â€“ specifically, one where a patient is being monitored by an in-home device capturing biometric data.
The guidance authors noted that, although they used cellular data-based biometric devices and addressed those using broadband communications, a future build may also implement an electronic health record system that would receive automated data from the telehealth platform provider.</p>
