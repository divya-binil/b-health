<p>Eighteen months ago, consumers scrambled to find healthcare providers who could test and vaccinate against COVID-19, and health practices had to make the backend shift to offer appointments based on supply to meet consumer demand.
To help meet demand, health tech company Solv partnered with the CDC’s VaccineFinder.org to create a large, high-volume capacity system to test and vaccinate consumers.
As a result, consumers now expect to be able to manage and book all of their healthcare needs quickly and accessibly, including diagnostic testing, more than ever before," Heather Fernandez, co-founder and CEO of Solv, told Fierce Healthcare.
Solv’s Test Finder helps consumers find providers who offer these services as quickly and easily as they can book a COVID test, according to the company.
Solv, a provider of same-day and next-day appointment software, is banking on a future healthcare system where digital-first patients want more on-demand, virtual experience.
Solv connects patients and providers in healthcare, according to company executives.</p>
