<p>In this episode, family doctor Lisa Baron and I talk about the prevalent problem of medical gaslighting, especially as it relates to women seeking treatment for chronic illnesses. We'll go into detail on the effects of ignoring symptoms and the significance of taking patients' concerns seriously. We will also discuss how social media may help patients find support and treatment choices, as well as strategies doctors can use to enhance their bedside manner and win back patients who have previously been gaslighted. Human talents are enhanced by ambient intelligence to improve our quality of life. There are many uses for it, particularly in healthcare. By utilizing the technology, ambient clinical intelligence is addressing the most important issues facing the healthcare industry today, including burnout, physician shortages, physician and patient dissatisfaction, and poor financial results.</p>
