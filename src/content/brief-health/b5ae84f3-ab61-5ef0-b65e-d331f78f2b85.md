<p>Butterfly, a digital health company transforming care through the power of handheld, whole-body ultrasound and connected medicine, today announced a new Proficiency Management Solution offered as part of its enterprise imaging platform, Butterfly Blueprint™.
Shaped by insights from the emergency medicine community, which has been on the leading edge of utilizing point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), Butterfly’s Proficiency Management Solution is designed to remove obstacles from standardizing ultrasound as core to “bedside” patient assessment, diagnosis, and treatment.
The Butterfly Proficiency Management System addresses much of this and will foster adoption more broadly across Emergency Medicine and many other specialties.”
Butterfly’s Proficiency Management Solution automates the management and analysis of ultrasound across an institution.
“Our Proficiency Management tool aims to streamline this education, and ultimately, to accelerate the adoption and utilization of ultrasound information in patient assessment, diagnosis, and treatment.”
