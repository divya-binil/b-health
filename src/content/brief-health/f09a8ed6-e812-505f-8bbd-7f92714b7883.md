<p>The State of the World’s Nursing 2020 report published by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there will be a shortage of 6 million nurses worldwide by 2030.1 With nurses playing such a key role in delivering high-quality patient care, this is a critical time for healthcare systems to focus on nurse recruitment and retention.
Join us as we continue the conversation with LeAnn Thieman to discuss simple strategies that top-tier hospitals are using to recruit and retain their nursing staff.
Some hospitals raise the salary of their nurses, which is one tactic, others give a stay-on or retention bonus.
HT: What strategies or conditions have you seen implemented by top-tier hospitals that lead to high nurse recruitment and more resilient nurses?
LeAnn Thieman: Some hospitals recruit their nurses through ads, however, the competition is high.
We sincerely truly care for you.” Potential nurse candidates have to be able to see how they’re going to be treated and be convinced that what this particular hospital does is above what the rest are offering.</p>
