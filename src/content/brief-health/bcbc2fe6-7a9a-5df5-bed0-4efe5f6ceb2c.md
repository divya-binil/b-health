title: Fewer than 4 in 10 health systems can successfully share data with other hospitals,
  survey finds
---

Fewer than 4 in 10 health systems can successfully share data with other health systems and these ongoing interoperability challenges are limiting strategic efforts to improve workflow, improve population health and reduce the cost of care.

Only 69% of technology executives at U.S. hospitals and health systems reported that they are effective at sharing data within their own organizations, according to a survey from the Center for Connected Medicine.

Health systems continue to face challenges sharing data with payers and patients—with about 58% of technology and business leaders reporting that their organizations are highly successful in these efforts. About half said their health systems can successfully share data with pharmaceutical organizations.
