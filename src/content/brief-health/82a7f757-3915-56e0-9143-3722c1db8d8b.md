<p>Informatics execs discussed challenges, benefits of integrating third-party apps to monitor COVID-19 patients and patients with postpartum hypertension. Yale New Haven Health recently conducted two pilot projects to deploy patient-centered clinical decision support apps that combined patient-generated health data with clinical data from the EHR to support remote patient monitoring.
The goal with this project was to integrate the patient-generated data into the EHR.
One of the first issues was to identify patients for enrollment, Lobach said.
But unfortunately, subscription was not implemented in the EHR, and HL7 version 2 was not implemented in the app, “so we ended up using an EHR rules engine in order to identify the patients for the enrollment.”</p>
