<p>A government programme has awarded two funds to a digital healthcare start-up to test gaming and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to aid in the early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Ascentys, situated in Yorkshire, was created with financing from Alzheimer's research UK. It has successfully obtained rounds of funding from Innovate UK in collaboration with Durham University and Hywel Dda University Health Board, including its highly coveted SMART award for innovation that is expected to have the greatest impact on the UK economy. International investors interested in investing millions of pounds have also shown interest. Its portion of the Â£25 million in government funding has been put aside to fund the creation and testing of a cutting-edge videogame that might significantly improve the way the NHS now treats the condition, which is one of the biggest healthcare challenges facing the entire world.</p>
