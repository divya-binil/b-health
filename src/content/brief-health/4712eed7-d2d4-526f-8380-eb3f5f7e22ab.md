<p>Trinity Health, a nonprofit and integrated healthcare system that serves northwestern North Dakota and eastern Montana, announced a partnership with Orexo, a pharmaceutical and digital therapeutics company, to provide digital therapeutics to Trinity Health patients.
Trinity Health will now offer Deprexis® and Vorvida® to help patients manage depression and excessive drinking.
Trinity Health serves over 25 counties and 200,000 people throughout North Dakota and Montana, including many patients in remote areas.
With this first-of-its-kind offering, we see Trinity Health becoming a frontrunner among U.S. healthcare systems in making digital therapeutics accessible to patients.”
During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as many healthcare workers saw a need for increased mental health support, Trinity Health launched a pilot program to make both Deprexis® and Vorvida® available to its staff and their dependents.
Following this successful pilot program, Trinity Health is delighted to now make these programs available to patients.
Orexo develops improved pharmaceuticals and digital therapies addressing unmet needs within the growing space of substance use disorders and mental health.</p>
