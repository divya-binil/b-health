<p>The actions brought the total number of enforcements carried out under the agency's HIPAA Right of Access Initiative to 25.
"Timely access to your health records is a powerful tool in staying healthy, patient privacy and it is your right under law," said OCR Director Lisa J.
As the press release notes, the Right of Access Initiative is intended to support individuals' ability to get their health records in a timely fashion at a reasonable cost, as HIPAA requires.
OCR has been carrying out right of access enforcement actions since 2019, when it fined a Florida hospital $85,000 for failing to give a pregnant woman access to her medical records.</p>
