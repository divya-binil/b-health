<p>About 25 percent of patients routinely used telehealth in 2022, according to a Jan. 9 report from the American Medical Association.&nbsp;According to a research released by the American Medical Association on Jan. 9, about 25% of patients will regularly use telehealth in 2022. There are still a number of modifications that need to be made to telehealth as it continues to gain popularity in order to make it more user-friendly for both patients and doctors. The&nbsp;</p><p>AMA has provided the following five forecasts for the development of telehealth in 2023:</p><ul><li>Telehealth will keep getting simpler to use. As more patients regularly use telehealth, more time, money, and technological advancements will probably be put into making it more usable.</li><li>The industry will transition to an all-encompassing technology. Medical professionals and tech companies working together will produce more streamlined technological solutions.</li><li>The management of chronic diseases will advance. Patients will have access to digital tools that go beyond prescription drugs for managing chronic illnesses. The use of more sensors, chat boxes, and symptom management features in wearable technology will enhance patient health and reduce mortality.</li><li>The subject of government funding will remain popular. Only if doctors are compensated fairly will telehealth expand, and in 2023, there will still be a regulatory battle over this issue.</li><li>More investors will invest in digital health and virtual care solutions. Investors will want to invest in increasing trends in healthcare and have funds to use.</li></ul>
