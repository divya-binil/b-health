<p>In-hospital mortality rates decreased by 33 percent at New York City-based NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn — previously named Lutheran Medical Center — after it merged with NYU Langone Health, a Jan. 6 study published in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2787652"><i>JAMA Network Open</i></a> found.</p><p>NYU Langone Health acquired the hospital in 2016. The study analyzed outcomes for 181,252 nonpsychiatric, nonrehabilitation and non-newborn patients discharged between Sept. 1, 2010, and Aug. 31, 2019, at the hospital.</p><p>The study found fewer central infections per 1,000 catheter days and fewer catheter-associated urinary tract infections per 1,000 discharges. More patients were likely to recommend the hospital after the merger than before.</p><p>The study did not find any significant improvements in readmission rates.</p><p>"Our study shows that when a hospital merger has a comprehensive strategy, focuses on quality and involves meaningful operational integration, outcomes can be significantly improved at the acquired hospital," lead study author Erwin C. Wang, MD, <a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/merger-leads-improved-quality-safety-nyu-langone-hospital-brooklyn">said</a> in Jan. 6 news release by NYU Langone Health.</p>
