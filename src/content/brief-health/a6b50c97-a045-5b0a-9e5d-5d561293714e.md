<p>The critical role of nursing, along with high nurse burnout rates have come into intense focus over the last six months. <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/943091">Nurses are burning out</a> at a rate four times higher than before the pandemic. The dramatic change occurred because nurses are continuously being tasked to perform additional non-nursing duties, while also caring for more critically ill patients. The <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/943091">Medscape Nurse Career Satisfaction Report 2020</a> states that “nurse’s burnout rate quadrupled since the pandemic. Medscape received responses from 10,424 nurses and APRNs in the United States and shows that in every group, more nurses rated themselves as very or somewhat burned out compared with the pre-pandemic period.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Daily requirements for nurses come from the government, regulating non-profits, best practice workflows, and internal initiatives. While all are important, many come with administrative tasks that clog the patient care workflow and cause confusion around nursing priorities. It requires tremendous effort to accomplish everything required without taking away from vital patient care. So, how do we remove as many non-nursing tasks as possible so nurses can practice at the top of their license?<br>&nbsp;</p>
