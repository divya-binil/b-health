<p>The 24 new technologies can be used in low-resource settings.<br><br>The World Health Organisation (WHO) has released a new compendium of innovative health technologies for COVID-19 and other priority diseases.</p><ul><li>The list provides an assessment of the technologies, carried out by a group of international experts working with WHO technical teams.</li><li>Fifteen of the 24 technologies are currently commercially available in countries, while the rest are still at the prototype stage.</li><li>The main objective is to select and assess technologies that can have an immediate and future impact on COVID-19 preparedness and response, potentially improve health outcomes and quality of life, and offer a solution to an unmet medical need.</li><li>The suitability of each technology is communicated through a traffic light scoring system, indicating whether the product is recommended (for use without any known limitations); recommended with caution (limitations may have been identified related to maintenance and need for trained staff); or not recommended (inappropriate, unsafe or unaffordable).</li></ul>
