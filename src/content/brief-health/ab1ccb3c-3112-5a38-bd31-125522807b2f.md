<p>Physicians believe the biggest barriers to their use of telehealth are payer related, according to survey results released in March by the American Medical Association.
More than half of physicians said their patient population's challenges with technology is an obstacle to telehealth, according to the AMA's March study.
Many physicians are also frustrated with telehealth platforms' inability to integrate interpreters for non-English-speaking patients and prefer using in-person visits for non-English speakers, according to an October study published in the National Library of Medicine.
Telehealth represents a new form of service for patients, cutting out the traditional aspects of a physician's visit that many may envision.</p>
