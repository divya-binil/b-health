<p>AI-enabled clinical decision support must be built on a foundation of evidence-based medicine in order to truly be of use.<br><br>In recent years, the healthcare industry has fully embraced the potential for <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> to transform healthcare practice and delivery. From the advent of big data to the arrival of <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/category/emr-ehr/">EHRs</a>, the industry is familiar with the hype that accompanies technology advancements. While these innovations have certainly been useful in many regards, healthcare remains deeply fragmented, inefficient, and prone to waste.&nbsp;</p><p>Many experts believe that AI will deliver on the long-promised transformation of healthcare by providing the connective tissue that ties our other technology advancements together. The industry will finally be able to merge data from multiple sources to provide valuable insights at the point of care. Workflow advances and time-saving automation will help decrease the administrative burden for both providers and payers, while new consumer uses for AI-enabled healthcare will more effectively engage patients in their own care.</p>
