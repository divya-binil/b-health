Florida State University (FSU) announced its Institute on Digital Health and Innovation, created by two new faculty members, aiming to integrate digital tools in nursing and medical education.

The institute, which will operate as an extension of FSU’s College of Nursing, will emphasize the use of digital tools in health education and treatment while also facilitating collaboration between the university and healthcare operators.

The consortium aligns with FSU’s ongoing expansion of healthcare-related research and education programs, as it strengthens its health research portfolio while seeking collaborations with groups in North Florida including Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare, HCA Florida, and the Mayo Clinic.
