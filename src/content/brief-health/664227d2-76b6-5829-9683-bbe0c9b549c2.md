<p>Six months after the anesthesiology department at Ochsner Health in New Orleans implemented its new AI scheduling system, the average engagement scores of 60 anesthesiologists increased from 3.3 to 4.2 out of 5, said researchers â€“ one of the largest improvements in the Ochsner Health system.
"We implemented AI scheduling of anesthesiologists in 2018 to increase control and flexibility and quickly saw the benefits," said Dr. Dhruv Choudhry, lead author of the study and anesthesiology resident at Ochsner Health in New Orleans, in a statement released by the American Society of Anesthesiologists.
"Our physicians understand that a long day or week will be reciprocated in the future with a shorter day or week, which was not possible with the previous system," explained Choudhry about Oschner's AI scheduling system in a statement.</p>
