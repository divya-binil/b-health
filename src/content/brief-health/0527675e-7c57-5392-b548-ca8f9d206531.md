<p>Advata will focus on revenue cycle management solutions and back-office management, as well as clinical decision support and population health. Health system Providence has launched software analytics company Advata by combining KenSci, Colburn Hill Group, Lumedic and three other companies.
Tegria combined Providence investments and acquisitions into a portfolio of services for healthcare consulting, revenue cycle management and software technology.
As healthcare costs rise and providers emerge from the financial battering inflicted by the pandemic, health systems are looking to technologies like AI and ML to drive analytics capabilities and manage costs.
However, despite using technology and analytics in their quest for solutions, a panel of provider, payer and tech experts speaking at HIMSS22 agreed that tech and data only get the healthcare system so far.
We are setting a new standard for advanced data analytics utilizing AI insights to enable smarter healthcare operations, reduce costs, and recover revenue."</p>
