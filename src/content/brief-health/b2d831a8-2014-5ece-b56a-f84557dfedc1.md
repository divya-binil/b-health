<p>The plan includes annual digital maturity assessments across the NHS.
England's plan for a "digital revolution" in health and social care has been released, including the introduction of annual digital maturity assessments across the NHS.
Aimed at health and social care leaders and industry partners, the plan outlines initiatives including Â£2 billion ($2.37 billion) of funding to support the implementation of electronic patient records (EPRs) in all NHS trusts and increase the availability of remote monitoring to help more than 500,000 people manage long-term health conditions at home.
All integrated care systems (ICSs) and their NHS trusts are aiming to have core digital capabilities, including EPRs in place by March 2025.
NHS Digital chief executive Simon Bolton said: "We are committed to working with our partners across health and social care to deliver the digitally enabled transformation of the NHS and create a system which provides better outcomes and access for patients."</p>
