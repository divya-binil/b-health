    The race coefficient has recently come under fire for being imprecise,
    leading to potentially worse outcomes for Black patients and less chance of
    receiving a new kidney. But how best to assess a patient’s kidney function
    remains uncertain, and some medical experts say fixing this equation is only
    one step in creating more equitable care.

<p>Alphonso Harried recently came across a newspaper clipping about his grandfather receiving his 1,000th dialysis treatment. His grandfather later died — at a dialysis center — as did his uncle, both from kidney disease.</p><p>“And that comes in my mind, on my weak days: ‘Are you going to pass away just like they did?’” said Harried, 46, who also has the disease.</p><p>He doesn’t like to dwell on that. He has gigs to play as a musician, a ministry to run with his wife and kids to protect as a school security guard.</p><p>Yet he must juggle all that around three trips each week to a dialysis center in Alton, Illinois, about 20 miles from his home in St. Louis, to clean his blood of the impurities his kidneys can no longer flush out. He’s waiting for a transplant, just as his uncle did before him.</p><p>“It’s just frustrating,” Harried said. “I’m stuck in the same pattern.”</p><p>Thousands of other Americans with failing kidneys are also stuck, going to dialysis <a href="https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/32/4/913.long">as they await new kidneys</a> that may never come. That’s especially true of Black patients, like Harried, who are about four times as likely to have kidney failure as white Americans, and who make up <a href="https://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/factsheets/African-Americans-and-CKD">more than 35%</a> of people on dialysis but just 13% of the U.S. population. They’re also less likely to get on the waitlist for a kidney transplant, and less likely to receive a transplant once on the list.<br>&nbsp;</p>
