<p>A designated Health Provider Shortage Area includes the rural health system. Patients now have access to care through virtual care, among many other advantages, that they would not otherwise have without extensive travel. Oak Orchard Health, a Brockport, New York-based health organization, was compelled to adjust practically every aspect of how it operated its clinics as a result of COVID-19, starting with its inability to treat patients in-person. The issue however, services were as important than ever. As a rural FQHC, Oak Orchard frequently experienced difficulties, difficulties that the epidemic exacerbated. Patients frequently lack access to safe transportation. Telehealth was the answer that Oak Orchard discovered, and it is still used today. While medical professionals are at the clinic or somewhere else, patients can remain at home.</p>
