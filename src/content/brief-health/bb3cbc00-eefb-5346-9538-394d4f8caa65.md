<p>Although digital twins are not always well defined, their applications are fascinating. High stakes situations, such as those in healthcare, make the limitations of digital twins obvious.

One of them is the concept of digital twins. The majority of us became familiar with the concept of a digital twin through the film Apollo 13, even though it wasn't even digital at the time. Ken Mattingly, an astronaut, spent hours on the ground in a simulator attempting to figure out a method to return the crew safely to Earth in their damaged spacecraft by attempting various sequences of actions that wouldn't exhaust the craft's limited supplies.</p>
