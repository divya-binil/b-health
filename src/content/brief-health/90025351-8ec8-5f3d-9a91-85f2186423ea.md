<p>EnPlace, a meshless, minimally invasive method for fixing the pelvic floor ligaments, was created by FEMSelect. New Age Ventures and TriVentures co-led the $9 million Series B fundraising round. Robin Hood Ventures, Mid Atlantic Bio Angels (MABA), MEDA Angels, Keiretsu Forum Mid-Atlantic, RAD BioMed, Keiretsu Capital, and Transpacific Venture Partners are additional investors in the round. According to the firm, the EnPlace system from FEMSelect is approved by the FDA for pelvic floor ligament fixation for the management of symptomatic uterine prolapse, a problem that affects approximately 50% of women over the age of 50. The uterus is frequently removed during today's operations, which many women would rather not have done. In less than 30 minutes, the technology allows for a minimally intrusive procedure.</p>
