<p>I occasionally create a "One Minute Challenge" video in which I try to explain a concept relating to digital health in under a minute. Here are several compiled tidbits, some of which are little over a minute long, sort of a crash course on the fundamentals. What is digital health in the first place? is covered in this first video. What is appropriate here and what is not? How will it alter the roles of patients and medical staff? So much can be squeezed into a little over 60 seconds. Even though Dr. Thomas Ferguson coined the term "e-patient" in 2006, the idea is still frequently misunderstood.&nbsp;</p>
