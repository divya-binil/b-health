<p>After raising $65 million in a Series C round approximately one month ago, Redesign Health, a company that builds, launches and finds funding for other healthcare startups, is laying off 67 employees, or roughly 20% of its workforce.
The company also said the layoffs can be tied to its continued strategic evolution as opposed to a financial decision as evidenced by its recent $65M Series C raise.
The layoffs at Redesign Health were first reported by Fast Company.</p>
