<p>Clearwater announced today that its planned merger with CynergisTek has been completed, bringing together two market leaders who are joining forces to serve the cybersecurity, privacy, and compliance needs of healthcare organizations, as well as those in other highly regulated industries.
In just over a month, Clearwater has combined with two other cybersecurity companies to create a solution set that includes a deep pool of experts across a broad range of cybersecurity, privacy, and compliance domains, proprietary purpose-built technology that enables efficient identification and management of cybersecurity and compliance risks, and a tech-enabled, 24x7x365 Security Operations Center with incident response capabilities.
For the past three years, either Clearwater or CynergisTek has been named the top Security Advisors &amp; Consultants in Black Book Market Research’s annual healthcare industry survey, which this past year drew responses from nearly 3,000 IT and security professionals representing nearly 900 provider organizations.&nbsp;</p><p>The merger of these three companies furthers Clearwater’s vision of building a recognized leader in cybersecurity, privacy, compliance, and risk management by offering the most comprehensive portfolio of products and services in the industry, all from a single, trusted partner.
“The combination of CynergisTek and Clearwater, bolstered by the additional managed security services and compliance services gained through Clearwater’s recent acquisition of TECH LOCK, equips us to deliver even greater value to organizations across the healthcare ecosystem and other regulated industries by creating a single solution provider that can address the industry’s growing list of cybersecurity needs,” Mr. Cagle continued.
Clearwater is a leading provider of cybersecurity, privacy, and compliance software, consulting, managed security services, and certification services for the healthcare industry and other highly regulated industries.</p>
