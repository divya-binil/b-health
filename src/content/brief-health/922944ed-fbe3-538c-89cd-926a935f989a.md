<p>Specialty care was significantly more likely to result in concordant diagnoses between telehealth and in-person appointments, compared with primary care. "In diagnoses confirmed through clinician opinion, such as many psychiatric diagnoses, there was a significantly greater concordance between video telemedicine diagnosis and in-person diagnosis," the study's authors wrote. "Primary care video telemedicine programs designed to accommodate new patients or new presenting clinical problems may benefit from a lowered threshold for timely in-person direct follow-up in patients suspected to have diseases typically confirmed by physical examination, neurological testing or pathology."</p>
