<p>How? Through&nbsp;telemedicine.&nbsp; After so much care went online during COVID-19, patients of all ages and backgrounds have completed a crash course in virtual care – and they are liking the results.&nbsp; In 2022, 17 percent of people sought out virtual mental or&nbsp;behavioral&nbsp;healthcare compared to just 11 percent in 2021,&nbsp;<a href="https://mailstat.us/tr/t/2nb3e0nkl9mywgf4/c/https:/www.evernorth.com/health-care-in-focus-report/hybrid-health-care#main-content">according to research</a>&nbsp;from Cigna’s Evernorth services group.&nbsp; Both employers and&nbsp;health&nbsp;plans are equally eager to make virtual&nbsp;behavioral&nbsp;health&nbsp;access a permanent feature of their offerings, the report added.</p><p>Telemedicine&nbsp;makes it easier for more patients in a wider geographical area to connect with skilled providers without the challenges of transportation, childcare, or taking excessive time off work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Take the example of the Indian&nbsp;Health&nbsp;System (IHS), which serves extremely remote and vulnerable American Indian and Alaskan Native communities across some of the most rugged and poorly connected regions in the country.&nbsp; Through&nbsp;<a href="https://hitconsultant.net/category/technology/telehealth-2/">telemedicine</a>, IHS patients can get consistent, culturally competent care from highly qualified social workers and psychiatrists at their local clinics or even in their homes – care that would be close to impossible if these communities had to rely solely on in-person&nbsp;behavioral&nbsp;healthcare.</p>
