<p>Q. How would you describe the history of Big Tech in healthcare?
A. The track record of Big Tech companies in healthcare is not a good one.
Most Big Tech healthcare initiatives have ended in failure, stifling true innovation in the sector and reducing the market's confidence in technologies that are successfully addressing real market needs.
Q. You suggest that most of the Big Tech systems are not customized for healthcare and require months or years to customize and are not scalable to address the needs of healthcare organizations.
Big Tech companies continually underestimate the problem healthcare has with "dirty data." Health data is rarely clean or consistent.
Oracle does have one thing in its favor that was absent from many other Big Tech companies that failed in the healthcare space.
Oracle has a known entity in Cerner that is well-versed in the challenges of healthcare and has already addressed many of the issues that have historically caused many other Big Tech companies to abandon their efforts in the space.
Q. What would Big Tech have to do to succeed where it has failed in healthcare?
When healthcare is only a piece of a Big Tech company's overall operation, it becomes expendable.
To succeed, Big Tech needs to go all in on healthcare just as many smaller companies purpose-built for healthcare have done.</p>
