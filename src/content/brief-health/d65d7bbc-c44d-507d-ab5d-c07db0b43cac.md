As the healthcare sector embraces value-based care, the patient – not the procedure – is the central focus for providers. But the move to patient-centered care requires several significant deviations from the status quo. 

For example, more personalized treatment is required through information sharing and collaborative decision-making among providers, patients and their families. There is also a greater need to focus on overall physical, mental and emotional well-being of patients, as well as more opportunities for self-service,  including access to their records, making payments and locating additional information.

But what exactly will it take to turn these goals into reality? For starters, providers must rethink their daily workflows to improve and expand the ways they interact with patients, other healthcare providers and payers. Technology must also be applied to support every appropriate stakeholder in order for patient-centered care to be a reality.
