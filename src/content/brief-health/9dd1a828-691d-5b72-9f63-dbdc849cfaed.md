<p>Nick Culley, director of ExR, gives an advance look at his HIMSS22 session, where he will offer his vision of how hospitals should function with leading-edge technology.<br><br>Rapidly advancing technology will require healthcare to undergo huge structural transformations as digitized health platforms change how communities interact with hospitals.
Culley will be discussing this model at the upcoming HIMSS22 conference in March in an educational session entitled "Hospitals of the Future: Design in a Digital World." Healthcare IT News interviewed him to offer readers an advance look at what he will be presenting at the show.
Q. How might healthcare technology alter how healthcare could be delivered in the future?
Novel healthcare technology is therefore designed to accommodate hospital structures, rather than vice versa.
A truly forward-thinking look at healthcare design will appreciate the exponential growth of technology, and hospitals of today will be designed with the technology of the future in mind.</p>
