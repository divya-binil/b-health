title: The Future of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare

Artificial intelligence has come a long way since it was first established as a field in 1956.

Over 60 years ago at Dartmouth College, a group of scholars organized by computer scientist John McCarthy coined the term, said CDW Data Center Architect Ken Cameron during his opening remarks at CDW•G’s AI Showcase at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. on Tuesday.

The Dartmouth group wanted to explore the possibilities of having machines solve problems that humans typically solved using their natural intelligence, Cameron said. Today, AI has evolved past that early research and development stage. “It’s now affecting our day-to-day lives,” he said.

“And we’re getting to a point where machines can start telling us things we don’t know,” said his co-presenter, Jeremy Wise, a CDW solution architect for AI and deep learning.
