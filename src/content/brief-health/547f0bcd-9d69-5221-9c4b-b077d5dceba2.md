<p>So far, I have tested about 40 medical gadgets that measure health parameters. Here are my advices for companies developing wearable health trackers.<br><br>I've tried and used roughly 150 devices and gadgets over the past two years that assess health metrics or vital signs. The evolution—from the original Fitbit to portable ultrasounds powered by artificial intelligence—is genuine, and I'm thrilled to have had the chance to witness it.</p><p>I also keep track of my health using a dozen different apps. I used information in an Excel spreadsheet to know more about my health and increase my motivation even before the wearable revolution began to take shape, much as I outlined in The Guide to the Future of Medicine. I can't imagine going for a run these days without collecting measurement data.</p>
