<p>This week at the Becker's Health IT, Digital Health and RCM Annual Meeting, FinThrive, Inc.TM, a healthcare revenue management software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider, announced the addition of new intelligent automation capabilities within its insurance discovery solution to address acute staffing shortages for hospitals and health systems. Better insurance discovery solutions are needed by healthcare providers, and FinThrive's new intelligent automation capabilities fill that requirement. The enhanced machine learning capabilities of FinThrive intelligently classify untapped revenue prospects according to the likelihood that the claim will be paid. Health systems decide which chances to pursue first by utilising this new algorithm. In tests, the model greatly surpasses worklist prioritising techniques currently in use, which generally prioritise claims only based on their cash value.</p>
