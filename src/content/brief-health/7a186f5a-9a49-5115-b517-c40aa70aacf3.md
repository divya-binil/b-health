<p>Technology giants and other non-traditional players are moving into the healthcare market, giving consumers a host of new options for how and where they obtain services. Everyone from Apple and Amazon to G.E. and Berkshire Hathaway are disrupting the market by introducing new delivery models that emphasize simplicity, transparency and positive digital experiences.&nbsp;</p><p>Traditional players will need to recalibrate how they build market share due to this new consumerism threat. In fact, a recent <a href="https://www.kaufmanhall.com/sites/default/files/documents/2019-06/2019_state_of_consumerism_in_healthcare_kaufmanhall_0.pdf">report from Kaufman Hall</a> found that 88% of surveyed healthcare providers agree or strongly agree that “… hospitals and health systems are vulnerable to consumer-friendly offerings from non-hospital competitors.”</p><p>Unless a healthcare organization is a specialized health system in geography with limited competition, chances are they will experience a shift in how consumers find services and providers and whether or not they choose to consume services from those providers.&nbsp;</p>
