<p>Today marks International Nurses Day – a day to commemorate the invaluable contribution nurses have made to our society.</p><p>During the pandemic, it is not so much actors, popstars or celebrity influencers that we have come to idolise, but the ordinary men and women among us who have stepped up during extraordinary times to provide care, comfort and compassion to those in pain or suffering.</p><p>It is natural and just that we focus attention on the victims of coronavirus, or those who have been blighted in other ways, such as physically, mentally or financially.</p>
