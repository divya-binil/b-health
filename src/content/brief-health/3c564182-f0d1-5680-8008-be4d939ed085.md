<p>This month we’ve had an added focus on <a href="https://www.healthcareittoday.com/tag/rpm">Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)</a> and all it’s nuances and features.&nbsp; No doubt a month still isn’t enough to fully understand this quickly changing area of health IT.&nbsp; The more I’ve learned about RPM and it’s related Chronic Care Management (CCM), the more I realize how complicated it is to do right.&nbsp; RPM companies require a mix of data collection, data analysis, patient communication, behavior change, and so much more.&nbsp; It’s definitely not for the faint of heart, but it also is one of the most promising areas of healthcare and is going to be key to value based care.&nbsp; In fact, many of the tools and technologies related to RPM are moving into other areas like surgical protocols for example.&nbsp; What does seem clear to me is every healthcare organization is going to need to consider how they’re approaching RPM and CCM.</p>
