<p>&nbsp;A big data framework combining epidemiological and socioeconomic risk factors revealed that COVID-19 risk increased in areas with more crowding, population mobility, and morbidity, while risk decreased after the deployment of effective public health interventions.</p><p>Research conducted during and after less severe pandemics, like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1, has shown that there was a gap in how these illnesses were detected and treated among different populations. Socioeconomically disadvantaged populations were more significantly impacted by these diseases than their more affluent counterparts.</p><p>For their study, the research team identified and used seven specific socioeconomic and epidemiological factors – including healthcare access, health behavior, crowding, area morbidity, education, social distancing measures, and population mobility – using South Korean incidence data.</p><p>The team filtered the study’s variables by using a conceptual mechanistic framework that describes the potential causes of disparities in the US during a pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
