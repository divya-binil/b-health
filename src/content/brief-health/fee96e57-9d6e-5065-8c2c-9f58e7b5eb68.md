<p>It is a grim irony that the greatest health crisis of our generation separated most Americans from their healthcare providers. During the early months of the<a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/coronavirus-covid-19/"> COVID-19 pandemic</a>, most medical practices that responsibly followed social-distancing guidelines drastically limited in-person visits or were shuttered entirely. But as doctors start to open their doors to patients again, one thing should be clear: We cannot go back to the way things used to be. For even though pre-COVID surveys showed that patients love their doctors, they also showed that they don’t love their interactions with their practices. As consumers, Americans are three times more likely to recommend a hotel or bank they’ve patronized than they are to recommend their healthcare provider — and are also about twice as likely to complain about them, according to a report by <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/accenture/conversion-assets/dotcom/documents/global/pdf/dualpub_25/accenture-think-your-patients-are-loyal.pdf">Accenture</a>.</p><p><a href="https://hitconsultant.net/2020/10/12/bouncing-back-stronger-a-playbook-for-reopening-medical-practices/#.X4Q7GtBKhPY">Read on hitconsultant.net</a></p>
