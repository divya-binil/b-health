<p>New regulatory provisions that allow healthcare systems to make donations of cybersecurity technology and services to physician practices could help greatly bolster security in the sector, says attorney Julie Kass of the law firm Baker Donelson.</p><p>In November, the Department of Health and Human Services' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the HHS Office of Inspector General issued final rules modifying so-called Stark Law and federal anti-kickback regulations (see: <a href="https://www.healthcareinfosecurity.com/hhs-rule-changes-allow-for-cybersecurity-donations-a-15440"><i>HHS Rule Changes Allow for Cybersecurity Donations</i></a>).</p><p>The new safe harbors allow hospitals, healthcare delivery systems and others to provide physician practices and other less-resourced healthcare providers with free cybersecurity technologies, such as hardware and software, as well as services.</p>
