<p>February 05, 2021 -&nbsp;EHR systems are constantly evolving. But while technology aims to help its users complete daily tasks, usability problems tend to arise.</p><p>Sometimes these problems occur at implementation. Yet, in reality, clinicians oftentimes encounter EHR usability issues during EHR optimization.</p><p>“Implementation of the EHR is not limited to a single event in time,” <a href="https://ehrintelligence.com/news/ehr-usability-issues-increase-after-implementation-and-optimization"><strong>wrote</strong></a> researchers at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. “Rather, the technology changes when&nbsp;newer features are added, or interfaces are redesigned. These upgrades may improve functionality, but they also require physicians to adapt to changes beyond the initial implementation.”</p><p>“Users are required to continually learn how to use the newer system and then to incorporate these upgrades into their clinical workflow, often with negative work and psychological impacts,” continued the researchers. “Studies suggest that this type of continual change, such as that required by changes to the EHR, can result decreased productivity, increased stress and increased burnout.”</p><p>To fix the most challenging and common EHR usability issues, such as EHR alerts, cognitive support matters, and objective encounters, top health IT professionals from across the country recommend refining the number of alerts, conducting EHR informatics training, and developing a centralized health IT help desk.</p>
