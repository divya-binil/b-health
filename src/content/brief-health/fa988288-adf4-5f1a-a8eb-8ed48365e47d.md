<p>In order to give payers and providers the infrastructure they need to implement value-based care (VBC), global digital engineering services giant Apexon and HSBlox, Inc., the industry leader in VBC programme administration, have teamed. The agreement integrates Apexon's visualisation data analytics platform services with the value-based administration (VBA) platform from HSBlox. Payers and providers will be able to align resources under value-based programmes and alternative payment models thanks to the combined technology and support services. Healthcare stakeholders at the nexus of VBC and total health can benefit from HSBlox solutions' safe, information-rich approach to patient-centric, event-based digital healthcare procedures. By supporting many-to-many relationships between entities in a VBC network and providing complicated hierarchy support, the HSBlox platform empowers whole health care in conventional clinical settings, the home, and in the community.</p>
