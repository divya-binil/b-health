Proper training on the cleaning guidelines will help increase compliance in practices that reduce the risk of patients developing HAIs. Effective cleaning guidelines that incorporate federal regulations best practices can support the safety of patients and hospital staff.
Creating and following a standardized cleaning checklist, especially for frontline environmental services staff, ensure hospital cleaning guidelines are understood and followed.
