title: Survey Finds Privacy and Security Key Barriers to Interoperability
---

The exchange of health information between hospitals and other provider organisations could result in more efficient delivery of care. A new survey, however, finds that security and data privacy issues continue to pose a big challenge in promoting interoperability in healthcare. The survey was conducted by the Trusted Network Accreditation Program (TNAP) collaborative, established to directly align with the development of the USA's 21st Century Cures Act and the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA).
