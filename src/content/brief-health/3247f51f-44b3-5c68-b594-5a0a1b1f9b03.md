<p>We strongly believe that only digital health can bring healthcare into the 21st century and make patients the point-of-care.</p><p>As solutions like <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/get-used-to-it-remote-care-is-the-new-norm/">remote care</a> are becoming the norm, <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/digital-health-tech-here-to-stay-after-covid-19/">3D-printing</a> disrupts the normal supply chain and even <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/new-study-the-state-of-artificial-intelligence-based-fda-approved-medical-devices-and-algorithms-an-online-database/">the number of life science studies</a> on tools like artificial intelligence (A.I.) skyrocket, it’s become clear that we are not anticipating the digital health era; we <i>are </i>in the digital health era due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>First and foremost, it’s an era defined by a cultural transformation that will upend the traditional structure of healthcare. Clinical-grade sensors are available outside of the ivory towers of medicine; patients demand such tools so that they can become more proactive in managing their health and with their use; healthcare professionals revitalise the core values of medicine: empathy, attention and time. Healthcare authorities and institutions can further serve as guides for patients.</p><p><a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/your-privacy-in-the-digital-health-era-the-medical-futurists-guide/">Read on medicalfuturist.com</a></p>
