<p>Sanford Health declared in a company-wide email that it was "streamlining the leadership structure and simplifying operations in a few focused areas," which resulted in layoffs in non-clinical sectors. Sanford Health CEO and President Bill Gassen wrote in the email that "these improvements have been motivated by our knowledge that at the end of every choice is a patient or resident, and that remains our focus point as we move our company forward." The adjustments "will not adversely influence patient or resident care in any manner," he continued. Sanford Health withheld information regarding how many staff were let go. Gassen stated in the email that Sanford Health is presently hiring for more than 6,000 positions.</p>
