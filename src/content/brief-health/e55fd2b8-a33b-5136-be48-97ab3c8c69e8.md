<p>From education to lunch ordering, from work to dating, talking about “digital” has changed these past months – everything is online. Our entire social network has transformed to such depths that it will be a long time to assess its effects. The operation of entire industries has changed, and, of course, healthcare is no exception. And although we have heard of the digital transformation in medicine for years now, what exactly it covers remains unclear.</p><p>I have worked with over 30 different pharmaceutical companies over the past 15 years, giving 100+ keynote speeches around the world live and online. Each one of them explained how they want to transform a conventional company through an organisational course towards a digital switchover. They all say:</p><ol><li>“<i>We are a conservative company.</i>”</li><li>“<i>We are going through an organisational journey/change.”</i></li><li>“<i>We want to embrace digital transformation.</i>”</li></ol><p>Based on these challenges, they often ask me to talk about the digital transformation and its direct impact on healthcare in my speeches. But I need to be honest: <strong>I don’t know what they mean by it</strong>. Let me explain why.</p><p>The healthcare industry is already using a gazillion of digital solutions. Medical professionals are actively using digital technologies, from mobile communications, telehealth solutions and digital analytics to chatbots and A.I. As such, medicine is going through a similar transformational journey as for example the banking sector did. Pharma companies feel the need to participate in this venture.</p>
