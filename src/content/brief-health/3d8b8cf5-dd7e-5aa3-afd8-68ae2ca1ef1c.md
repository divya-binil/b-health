<p>The new Software Modernization Strategy calls for an enterprise approach to the services needed to build software. Its main goals include increasing migration to an enterprise cloud, establishing a departmentwide software factory ecosystem and transforming processes to enable faster and more resilient code deployment.</p><p>Weiss said a key enabler of achieving these goals will be a collaboration between the 29 software factories and creating “enterprise shared services.”</p><p>“Our ability to execute as a single team means we actually need to start sharing more,” he said.</p><p>How that sharing will work is still an unanswered question. Some collaboration will come down to the factories publishing reference designs, sharing tools they build and signing agreements like <a href="https://www.fedscoop.com/kessel-run-and-platform-one-sign-collaboration-agreement/">Platform One and Kessel Run recently did</a>.</p>
