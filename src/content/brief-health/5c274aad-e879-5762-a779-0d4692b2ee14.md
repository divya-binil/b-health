<p>Hologic, which makes mammography machines, could see an increase in its installed base, according to Needham analysts. According to a research note published on Tuesday by Needham analyst Mike Matson, Hologic, which commands a significant portion of the market for mammography systems, could profit from new guidelines decreasing the optimal age for breast cancer screening. The suggested beginning age for screening mammograms has been lowered from 50 to 40 by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), according to a preliminary guideline published on Tuesday. According to Matson, Hologic's install base for mammography machines might grow if screening rates among women aged 40 to 49 rise. If adopted, the proposed guidelines would replace the USPSTF's earlier recommendations, which left it up to the individual whether to start screening after age 40. The Task Force explained the modifications by stating that the incidence of breast cancer "gradually increased among women."</p>
