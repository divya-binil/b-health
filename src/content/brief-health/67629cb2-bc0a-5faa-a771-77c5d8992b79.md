---

The company is building the world's largest RWE platform in behavioral health and chronic diseases to expand data-driven, evidence-based care for people managing behavioral health conditions. Founded in 2015, Singapore-headquartered digital health and data analytics company Holmusk yesterday announced a $21.5 million funding round, led by Optum Ventures (OV) and Health Catalyst Capital (HCC) and included existing investors Heritas Capital and other individuals.

Dr Vijay Barathan from OV and Charles Boorady from HCC will be joining the Board of Directors.

Holmusk has offices in New York City, London and Shanghai. The new funding round allows Holmusk to expand its US operations in New York City, and enables investment in its proprietary technology to harness and analyze real-world data to accelerate drug development and data-driven medicine.
