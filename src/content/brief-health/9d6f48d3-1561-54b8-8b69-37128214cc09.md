<p>A healthcare AI expert offers advice to help health system CEOs and CIOs, physicians and nurses appreciate the promise of burgeoning machine learning technologies.<br><br>Many health IT decision-makers and clinicians are cynical about the potential for artificial intelligence solutions to improve healthcare, particularly <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/diagnostics/how-ibm-watson-overpromised-and-underdelivered-on-ai-health-care">in the wake of high-profile setbacks</a>&nbsp;and continued frustration at care recommendations that seem to come from a black box of technological machinations with little transparency or context.</p><p>It seems to boil down to a matter of trust: AI developers need to prove the technology's promise to healthcare end users, many of whom are still (often rightly) skeptical about algorithms' shortcomings.</p><p>Industry groups, whether they're focused on <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/amia-has-suggestions-build-trust-ai-clinical-decision-support">clinical informatics</a>&nbsp;or on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/cta-intros-new-trustworthiness-standard-healthcare-ai">consumer technology</a>, have been keenly focused on this idea recently.</p>
