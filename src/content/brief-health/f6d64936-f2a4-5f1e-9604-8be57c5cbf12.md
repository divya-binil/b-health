  <p>Deprescribing is the process of intentionally reducing or stopping
  medication that may no longer be necessary or beneficial for a patient. It
  involves a systematic review of a patient's medication regimen to determine
  which medications can be safely discontinued, reduced, or substituted with
  alternative treatments. The goal of deprescribing is to reduce the risk of
  adverse drug events, improve quality of life, and decrease healthcare costs.
  This approach is particularly important for older adults who may be taking
  multiple medications, as they are more susceptible to drug interactions and
  adverse effects. Deprescribing should only be done under the guidance of a
  healthcare professional who can carefully evaluate a patient's medication
  regimen and monitor for any potential side effects or withdrawal symptoms.</p>

<p>University of Michigan poll suggests more people should take advantage of benefit offered by Medicare and other insurance: a comprehensive medication review by a pharmacist or other provider. A recent survey of elderly individuals reveals increased support for the trend towards "deprescribing" drugs. Eighty percent of persons between the ages of 50 and 80 would be willing to quit taking one or more prescription medications if a doctor said it was safe to do so. Already, 26% claimed to have done so within the previous two years. According to the latest findings from the University of Michigan National Poll on Healthy Ageing, 67 percent of those who were willing to quit taking a drug said they would probably ask for help on doing so at their subsequent appointment with a provider. However, the survey also highlights the significance of patient and provider communication when deprescribing, a concept.</p>
