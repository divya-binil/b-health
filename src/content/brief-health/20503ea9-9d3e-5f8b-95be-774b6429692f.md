<p>The Translational Research Institute for Space Health is seeking proposals for a health and data platform for space travel. A health and data platform for space travellers is being developed, and Baylor College of Medicine's Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH) and its collaborators are looking for proposals. The request, which closes on May 10, was discussed on MobiHealthNews by James Hury, the deputy director and chief innovation officer of TRISH. He also explained why data management technology is necessary as private space exploration increases. This financial opportunity is genuinely special. We are quite enthusiastic about it. We have the chance to conduct a lot of health and research management in space, which is a really challenging setting. However, because of what we're doing, it does in fact apply to low-resource healthcare on Earth, and perhaps even to healthcare provided at home.</p>
