<p>As we noted <a href="https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/finance-revenue-cycle/news/21235718/kaufman-hall-report-delta-variant-surge-damaged-hospital-margins-in-july">in a news article published late last month</a>, “A clinical fact—the dramatic surge in cases of the Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus—is now having a major impact on hospitals’ and health systems’ bottom lines.”</p><p>We noted that “The August 2021 <a href="https://www.kaufmanhall.com/insights/research-report/national-hospital-flash-report-summary-august-2021?utm_source=agcy&amp;utm_campaign=2021-nhfr&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_term=august-2021-nhfr">‘National Hospital Flash Report,’</a> published on Aug. 24 by the Chicago-based <a href="https://www.kaufmanhall.com/about-us">Kaufman Hall consulting firm</a>, outlines some ominous developments. As <a href="https://www.kaufmanhall.com/insights/research-report/national-hospital-flash-report-summary-august-2021?utm_source=agcy&amp;utm_campaign=2021-nhfr&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_term=august-2021-nhfr">an introduction to the report posted to the company’s website</a> noted, ‘A resurgence of COVID-19 cases from rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant is raising new uncertainties for hospitals and health systems across the country. Organizations experienced setbacks in July as the variant drove dramatic spikes in new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, according to the latest issue of Kaufman Hall’s ‘National Hospital Flash Report.’ Margins and volumes both fell across key metrics compared to pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019. While revenues rose above 2019 levels, those gains were offset by escalating expenses. The July results also suggest that some healthcare consumers once again may be postponing non-urgent procedures and other outpatient care due to COVID-19 concerns.’”</p>
