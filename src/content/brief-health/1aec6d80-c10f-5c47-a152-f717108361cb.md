Healthcare marketing is not meant to be a black box and healthcare organizations should have complete visibility into the tactics, approaches and thinking behind the strategies being proposed by agency partners.

“We are incredibly honored by the Award,” stated Silberman. “It was really meaningful and validating for the True North Custom team who put in so much hard work this past year but what meant more to us was that two of our clients won Medigy HITMC Awards for _their_ work. That was tremendously satisfying.”
