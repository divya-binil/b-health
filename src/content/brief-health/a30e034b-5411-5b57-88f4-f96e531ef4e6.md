title: Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM renew pledge to support health data interoperability
---

Last August, six of the world's largest technology giants publicly committed to supporting interoperability in healthcare and to take steps to advance data-sharing standards.

A year later, the cloud technology leaders say they have made notable progress toward reducing barriers to interoperability including the release of open-source software and the development of new standards.

The six companies and competitors—Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and Salesforce—announced a renewed commitment to interoperability at the CMS Blue Button 2.0 Developer Conference on Tuesday afternoon.
