<p><strong>Sheba Medical Center launches remote monitoring program for children</strong></p><p>Israel’s <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/emea/abu-dhabi-s-department-health-collaborate-sheba-medical-center">Sheba Medical Center</a> and the Heart Institute at Safra Children's Hospital have partnered to launch a programme for children with complex heart defects.</p><p>The program will use remote monitoring technology provided by <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/emea/israels-sheba-hospital-turns-telehealth-treat-incoming-coronavirus-exposed-patients">Datos Health</a>, a member of Sheba’s Accelerate, Redesign, Collaborate (ARC) telemedicine hub. This technology integrates sensors and other inputs to transmit data from infants’ vital signs to the care team, enabling clinicians to intervene at the first signs of a potential risk.</p><p>Iris Shtein, co-director of the telemedicine Hub at ARC, said: “The connected platform developed by the Datos team, supported by ARC, enables Sheba clinicians to maintain transparency on their young, vulnerable patients between hospital visits, enabling more proactive care, and providing a sense of control to parents at such a crucial time.”</p><p><strong>ORCHA creates online platform for UK healthcare professionals</strong></p><p>The Organisation for the Review of Care and Health Apps (<a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/ata-partners-orcha-develop-approved-app-library">ORCHA</a>) is launching a digital health academy to support health and care professionals in using digital health tools.</p><p>Pharma firm Boehringer Ingelheim is sponsoring the online training portal, which will be available in March 2022 and aspires to improve the digital skills of all NHS health and care professionals by 2031.</p><p>Dr Neville Young, director of enterprise and innovation, Yorkshire and Humber Academic Health Science Network, said: “A digital health academy is a must, because, although it’s great that healthcare providers are continuing to invest in digital health, it’s vital that we also provide our brilliant health and care professional staff with the right knowledge to enable them to use the tools on offer to deliver the best care for patients.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Healthtech startup Cerebriu partners with Danish hospital</strong></p><p>Herlev and Gentofte Hospital in Denmark has introduced a software solution from University of Copenhagen spin-out Cerebriu to optimise its radiology workflow and resource allocation.</p><p>The Apollo software employs proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) technology,&nbsp;Smart Protocol, to indicate potentially relevant pathologies on brain MR images, and suggest follow-up actions during the examination. This enables better and faster workflow decisions to be made before a radiologist would normally have the chance to review images.</p><p>Robert Lauritzen, Cerebriu CEO, said: “This is a major step on our mission to automate radiology workflow, increasing quality of care by bringing our Smart Protocol technology within neuroimaging.”</p>
