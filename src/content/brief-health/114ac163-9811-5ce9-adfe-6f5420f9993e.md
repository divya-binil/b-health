<p>The presence of real-time location systems also can help hire new talent and improve the workplace for nurses during the nursing shortage, one expert says.
We sat down with him to discuss how RTLS can help prevent workplace violence and ensure fast response times from security personnel, why RTLS-designed facilities can help when seeking to hire new talent, and some ways technology can be used to improve the workplace for nurses as the nursing shortage worsens.
 As hospitals and other healthcare facilities continue recuperating from the fallout of COVID-19 and navigating increased workplace violence, RTLS provides a cost-effective staff duress solution that prevents threats from escalating to dangerous events.
Leadership and security directors can consider RTLS duress solutions that offer clinical-grade locating, which provides the most precise locating for a staff member, patient or asset.
</p><p>As leadership at health systems and facilities look for new ways to hire and retain staff, they must first pause to reconsider current tactics and ensure they're supplying their teams with the support and safety they truly need.
By implementing RTLS, facility leadership can provide a robust staff duress solution and other crucial resources that benefit the overall health, safety and efficiency of staff.
Beyond staff duress, additional RTLS solutions grant healthcare workers better assistance and provide the support new hires want to see.
Healthcare facilities can leverage RTLS to decrease bottlenecks in clinical workflow, enhance the overall coordination of patient care, reduce manual documentation, increase safety for all, and streamline procedures and compliance.
Integrations with nurse call systems, EHRs, and dedicated solutions that support clinical workflow automation, asset management, real-time temperature monitoring and more, provide additional workplace benefits for nurses and staff.
By implementing RTLS for asset management, nursing can locate critical equipment within minutes â€“ saving precious time, reducing stress and ensuring timely care.</p>
