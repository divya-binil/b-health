<p>The integration of PREFcardsTM, a cloud-based surgical preference card system, into surgical workflows has been announced by LiveData, the industry leader in data-driven surgical care. This will increase operational efficiency and accuracy. In addition to enhancing patient safety, reducing the effects of staff shortages, and meeting the increased demand for operating room (OR) time, LiveData's field-proven PeriOp Manager combined with PREFcards will raise surgeon satisfaction and minimise operation costs. We're eager to exhibit the LiveData PeriOp Manager product suite at ORMC this year and learn more about the problems that hospital and ambulatory surgery centre directors are facing. At the OR Manager Conference, LiveData and PREFcards will provide presentations in Booth 326. Next week, October, the event will take place.</p>
