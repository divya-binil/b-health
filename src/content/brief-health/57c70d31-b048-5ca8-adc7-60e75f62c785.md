<p>The following is a guest article by Janelle Estes, Chief Insights Officer at UserTesting, a video-based human insight platform.In a world that runs at lightning speed and thrives on instant gratification, getting in to see a doctor tends to be a painfully slow exception.On average, it takes 26 days to schedule a new patient appointment in-office in large U.S. cities, according to a recent study by medical staffing firm AMN Healthcare. Telehealth had already being developed and innovated in recent years, but utilisation soared during the epidemic as individuals looked for alternatives to in-person visits, and it is still high today. The utilisation of telehealth is 38 times more than it was prior to COVID-19, according to a McKinsey research. The outcome is healthcare consumerization, which is revolutionising the market much as how digitization has upended so many other industries, including retail. As options and expectations increase, the balance of power has moved from bureaucracies as a whole to individuals. The truth is that having to wait 26 days for a doctor's appointment appears unjustified in today's on-demand society where consumers can order nearly anything from Amazon and have it delivered to their door a day or two later. In digital healthcare delivery, several factors are important to ensure quality and patient satisfaction:</p><ul><li>User experience: A user-friendly and accessible platform that is intuitive and easy to use for patients and healthcare providers.</li><li>Data privacy and security: Robust security measures to protect sensitive patient information and ensure data privacy.</li><li>Integration with existing systems: Seamless integration with existing healthcare systems and data sources to avoid duplicating efforts and ensure continuity of care.</li><li>Evidence-based medicine: The use of evidence-based medicine and guidelines to inform treatment decisions and ensure high-quality care.</li><li>Clinical outcomes: Evidence of improved clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction through the use of digital healthcare delivery solutions.</li><li>Accessibility: Accessibility for patients with disabilities and those in remote or underserved areas to ensure equitable access to care.</li><li>Interoperability: Interoperability with other digital health systems to exchange and utilize patient information, streamline care, and avoid duplication of effort.</li><li>Telehealth capabilities: The ability to provide virtual care and consultations through telehealth technology, allowing patients to receive care from the comfort of their own homes.</li><li>Cost-effectiveness: Evidence of cost-effectiveness compared to traditional in-person care and cost savings for both patients and healthcare providers.</li></ul>
