<p>The market's stormy waters have caused a considerable delay in investment in digital health, but both buyers and builders are grabbing the opportunity to look at mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) as strategic opportunities. In their most recent study, Rock Health delves into four M&amp;A strategies that acquirers are pursuing at the current market moment, as well as the sell-side and buy-side factors that are creating conditions favourable for M&amp;A activity. Similar to the overall funding situation, digital health M&amp;A exploded in 2021, averaging roughly 23 deals per month for a yearly total of 273 agreements. This trend persisted throughout the first two months of 2022, with January and February 2022 averaging 23 deals monthly.</p>
