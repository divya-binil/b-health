<p>Users can connect with a Teladoc Health provider via audio by saying "Alexa, I want to talk to a doctor."<br><br>Teladoc Health announced this week that it was partnering with Amazon to launch voice-activated virtual care on Alexa-supported Echo devices.
"By introducing and integrating our virtual-first care experience with Echo devices, we are providing an innovative and convenient way for users to connect with a doctor," Donna Boyer, chief product officer at Teladoc Health, said in a statement.
As part of the new offering, customers can say "Alexa, I want to talk to a doctor," to their supported Echo device to get connected with a Teladoc call center.
"Weâ€™re excited to work with Teladoc Health to offer our customers an easy, hands-free way to connect with a doctor," said Debra Chrapaty, vice president and chief operating officer at Amazon Alexa.</p>
