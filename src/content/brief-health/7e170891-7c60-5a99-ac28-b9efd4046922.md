      We at eClinicalWorks have dedicated our careers to improving healthcare.
      We listen to our customers and are proud that they consider us their
      partners. Each of our 5,000+ employees is working toward a common goal of
      providing the healthcare technology solutions of today and tomorrow. For
      more than 20 years, eClinicalWorks has been fulfilling a dream to provide
      the best products and cloud-based solutions for every customer. It is that
      dream that drives us, that doesn't let us sleep, and that guides the
      spirit of constant innovation that has made eClinicalWorks a leader in
      healthcare IT.


      eClinicalWorks was founded in 1999 with a simple goal: Rid doctors offices
      of paper and make every connection providers need to pharmacies, labs, and
      supply chains. Our intent then was to digitize and improve communications
      and workflows. That remains true. But today, our mission has grown to
      become one of redefining what is possible and expected in healthcare IT.

<p>The vendor will also be discussing its healthcare information search technology, EHR documentation, practice management, patient engagement and population health.<br><br>A. Looking ahead, eClinicalWorks is focused on expanding its healthcare information search tool, PRISMA, to create a stronger network EHR.
This EHR interoperability solution enables fast and accurate decision-making that can be lifesaving, empowering medical professionals across the nation to better know their patients and provide effective clinical care.
A network EHR is the difference between calling one provider to obtain medical records and having the entire medical community on a nationwide "conference call." Access to multiple connections within the healthcare industry and quality healthcare data will create the interoperable EHR network of the future.
As emphasized in the 21st Century Cures Act, a holistic view of healthcare data is valuable for both patients and providers.
This is key to creating a functioning, value-based healthcare system, and eClinicalWorks' PRISMA is essential to taking a "one patient, one record" approach in healthcare.
Over the past two years, digital healthcare has accelerated at an unprecedented rate, so we'll highlight how providers turned to digital options like cloud computing and advanced population health tools to provide holistic patient care anywhere, any time while avoiding physician burnout.
eClinicalWorks offers a cloud-based, unified solution for a variety of services such as EHR documentation, practice management, patient engagement and population health, with tailored databases and personalized timelines for every provider to meet unique specialty and regional patient needs.
For example, our RPM technology enables the monitoring of patients outside clinics, collecting and transmitting vital data back to the EHR, as well as allows providers to comply with the CMS RPM program.
From automating the front office of any medical facility, to remotely monitoring patients for real-time patient health data, automation will empower providers with more patient data to maximize positive patient outcomes and focus on preventative care.
With plans to continue promoting price transparency initiatives through 2024, healthcare CIOs and IT leaders must start implementing technologies to help providers and practices comply with these new regulations.
eClinicalWorks is creating technology to help hospitals meet price transparency regulations, and we're excited to see how health IT evolves to make pricing information readily available for patients.</p>
