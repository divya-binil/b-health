<p>An industry leader in physician recruitment, Jackson Physician Search, and the Medical Group Management Association (MGMA) have conducted new research to confirm that physician burnout and turnover rates are still dangerously high as a result of the stress brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing staffing shortages. Back from Burnout: Confronting the Post-Pandemic Physician Turnover Crisis, a new report, draws information from hundreds of administrators and doctors who participated in the 2022 Physician Burnout, Engagement and Retention Survey, which was commissioned by Jackson Physician Search in collaboration with MGMA and carried out in August 2022. The poll aims to discover how medical groups may improve physician recruitment, engagement, and retention as well as these industry experts' unique perspectives on physician challenges in the wake of the pandemic and staffing crisis in healthcare.</p>
