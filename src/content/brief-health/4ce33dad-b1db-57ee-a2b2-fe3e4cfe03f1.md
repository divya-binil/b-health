<p>How can health plans protect their members from fraudulent healthcare apps and bad actors? And how can they ensure 3rd party apps are helpful to their members?<br><br>The <a href="https://thehcbiz.com/cms-nprm-payer-perspective/">CMS Patient Access Rules</a> are coming. And they’re easy to cheer for. We’re giving patients their data and that’s a huge win! We all love that!</p><p>But what we don’t love is when FraudulentHealthcareApp.com collects patient data and sells it to the highest bidder to support targeted marketing, or whatever other nefarious act they can come up with. Well, the health plans don’t get to pick and choose which apps they connect to. What if their member wants to use FraudulentHealthcareApp.com? What’s their recourse? How can they educate and protect their members?</p><p>On this episode, we’re sharing another of Shahid’s recent panels. This one from <a href="https://ain.events/hdu/">Health Data Unbound</a>, and it’s like an #HCBiz super panel as we’ve had all 4 of the panelists on the show in the past. The panel asks the question: “How Will Patients Securely Connect 3rd Party Apps To Their Data Once Patient Access Rules Kick In?” And they will be kicking in on July 1st of this year (2021).</p>
