<p>The Sequoia Project, a non-profit and trusted advocate for nationwide health information exchange, released the final version of the set of resources designed to help regulated entities better comply with the information blocking requirements of the 21st Century Cures Rule.
These documents were developed by The Sequoia Project’s Information Blocking Compliance Workgroup (IBWG), which is supported by The Sequoia Project’s Interoperability Matters initiative.
The IBWG developed the resources to support the healthcare industry as it navigates compliance with the information blocking rules issued by the federal government’s Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC), including considerations that arise from the move to the full definition of EHI beginning October 6, 2022.</p>
