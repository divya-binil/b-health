<p>It is appropriate that the parallel realities offered by the metaverse paint an upbeat future while reality post-Covid-19 becomes more and more burdened with economic, geopolitical, and social headwinds. A global technological gold rush has been sparked by the metaverse's potential to revolutionise entertainment, employment, commerce, and social life; yet, much has to be learned about its potential effects on healthcare. Despite the metaphorical metaverse's numerous layers, it may be summed up as an online environment that is exponentially more experienced, interactive, and distinguished by its immersive nature rather than one that is gradually more of these things. It stands for the "second coming of the internet," a reinvention that is enhanced and created with components of hyperconnectivity, augmented and virtual reality, and artificial intelligence.</p>
