[Amazon Web Services](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/tag/amazon-web-services) is now accepting applications for the latest cohort of its [Healthcare Accelerator](https://www.kidsx.health/aws-accelerator/), which this year will target improving health outcomes for underserved communities.Â 

The accelerator will accept 10 startups focused on increasing access to healthcare, reducing disparities by managing social determinants of health and using data for equity in healthcare. The companies will receive connections to venture capital firms, help with business planning, AWS training, opportunities to work with AWS partners, and go-to-market planning.

This is the [second year of AWS&#39; accelerator](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/aws-looks-digital-health-new-accelerator) in the U.S., and it recently launched a [UK-based program](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/emea/aws-launches-healthcare-accelerator-programme-uk-startups) that began in March.

Applications are due July 1, and the program will begin in late August.
