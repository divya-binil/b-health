<p>Locked algorithms do what we humans teach them to do, while adaptive algorithms learn to understand more from the data they crunch<br><br>So far, type A algorithms have been put into practice and approved by regulatory bodies like the FDA.
While the term might not be familiar to most, “locked” algorithms in medical devices are what regulatory authorities have approved of in the recent past.
The U.S.-based regulatory body has cleared or approved a number of those; and The Medical Futurist Institute pioneered the first open-access, online database of these FDA-approved A.I.-based algorithms.</p>
