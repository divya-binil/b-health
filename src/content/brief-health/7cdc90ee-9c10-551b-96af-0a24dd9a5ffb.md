<p>For decades, healthcare put up with the reality of “big iron” EHR and other legacy systems, surrounded by a patchwork quilt of point solutions, each evolving at an agonizingly slow pace and out of sync with others, each a walled garden of data, and all with virtually no consideration for the patient experience.
It’s happening again with Plaid creating a data transfer cloud for financial services companies, accelerating the creation of Chime, Betterment, Alto, Wave, and countless other fintech innovators.
Healthcare is under unprecedented pressure to accelerate digital innovation, thanks to a perfect storm of market forces—the pandemic, the Singularity, rising consumerization, the drive for health equity, EHR interoperability gaps, the need for advanced analytics for value-based programs, competitive threats from incumbents and big tech introducing new business and delivery models, regulatory policy, new payment models (ACOs, CMS innovation models, etc.).
Compare the friction-free experience of using Amazon or Uber to any healthcare experience.
There’s no unified patient record, no universal healthcare platform, to drive a unified, friction-free digital patient experience.
It’s now clear to leaders across the industry that we must shift towards a modern infrastructure, where we can bring all of our data together to understand the patient not only better, but completely; make informed decisions in real time; and give patients a friction-free digital experience whenever they logon to the health system.
That’s the promise of the cloud revolution for healthcare: to innovate much faster than ever before and achieve the holy grail of integration and interoperability that we’ve come to expect in every other industry.
And that’s what more than 50 health systems, payers, life sciences companies, and digital health startups customers are doing on the Innovaccer Health Cloud, the industry’s first and only “full stack” cloud platform for healthcare.</p>
