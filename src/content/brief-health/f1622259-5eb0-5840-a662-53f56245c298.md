<p>The coronavirus pandemic set in motion a cascade of changes in healthcare, and no sector was impacted more than digital health. The fledgling industry rapidly accelerated as COVID-19 changed technology helping patients receive care outside of the hospital or doctor's office into a necessity, instead of a luxury.</p><p>That acceleration has continued into 2021, and could even increase this year, experts say, creating a sea change in healthcare delivery and operations. Global healthcare industry revenues are expected to exceed $2.6 trillion by 2025, up from $2 trillion last year, with the majority of that growth propelled by artificial intelligence and telehealth, according to consultancy Frost &amp; Sullivan.</p><p>Much of that growth could take place as the U.S. continues to grapple with the pandemic. As tech and data sharing becomes more pervasive, healthcare will likely pivot to become more predictive instead of reactive. Virtual care will continue to invade previously analogue modes of care delivery, giving rise to new modalities of care, and companies will invest more in cybersecurity as a result.</p><p>It's a time of historic volatility and few sure bets. But here's what experts are prepping for in digital health this year.</p>
