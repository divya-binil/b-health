<p>Diabetes management company Hygieia extended its Series B round, and Autonomize AI, a workflow platform for healthcare and life sciences, also announced funding. The $22.5 million Series B financing round for the patient billing and communication platform Inbox Health has been completed, bringing its total funding to more than $43 million. Existing investors Vertical Venture Partners, CT Innovations, Healthy Ventures, Commerce Ventures, and Fairview Capital joined Ten Coves Capital in leading the round. The managing partner of Ten Coves Capital, Steven Piaker, will become a member of the board of directors for Inbox Health. The business provides a solution with AI capabilities that automates billing and payments. The system was created to provide patients with more information about their fees. In addition to receiving support for billing-related queries by text, email, and live chat, patients can pay their medical bills via text, email, or paper. The money will be applied to the company's strategic expansion.</p>
