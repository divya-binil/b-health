<p>The agency's analysis suggests increases in interoperability and patient-provider communication, along with frequent use of mobile health apps.<br><br>A brief out this month from the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT found an increase in patient portal access and online medical record download rates over the past few years. &nbsp;</p><p>In 2020, <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/data/data-briefs/individuals-access-and-use-patient-portals-and-smartphone-health-apps-2020">the agency said</a>, about six in 10 individuals throughout the country were offered access to their patient portal, and nearly 40 percent accessed their record at least once. &nbsp;</p><p>About a third of patient portal users downloaded their online medical record in 2020, nearly double the proportion of 2017. &nbsp;</p><p>"Making it easier for individuals to access and use their electronic health information is a national priority," wrote agency representatives in the brief.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
