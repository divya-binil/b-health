<p>When a pandemic put a strain on the healthcare sector, technologists set out to develop tools to ease the work of healthcare professionals. However, due to unequal access to digital tools and overworked hospital staff, this plan's flaws became apparent. At a recent stakeholder chat sponsored by Verizon 5G, we put this topic to a number of IT professionals. Members of the healthtech and medtech communities in Baltimore, DC, and Philadelphia were brought together by Technical.ly to talk about this transition, the advantages and difficulties of setting up shop in each city, and the difficulties posed by the epidemic. Additionally, we were interested in learning how technology would improve healthcare in 2022.</p>
