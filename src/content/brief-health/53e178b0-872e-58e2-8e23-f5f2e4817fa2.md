December 20, 2019 - The close of 2019 brings an end to a decade of significant digital transformation across the healthcare industry, which now generates massive amounts of data that can inform strategies for improving the patient experience, population health, and cost.

High-quality data will be instrumental to industry-wide efforts to achieving these improvements, but only if that information is shared and made actionable to stakeholders. Technology can be an enabler of change, but it alone isnâ€™t the answer.
