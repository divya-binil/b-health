<p>Vein scanners are handheld devices helping a nurse or a phlebotomist to find the right vein to take your blood sample for the first try.<br><br>Older, dehydrated patients with their sunken or collapsed veins might make even the most experienced phlebotomist sweat a little.
Here is where devices like the Aimvein Pro Vein Finder can shine.
Besides the handheld, quite lightweight scanner itself, the box includes a user manual, a charger/power cable, a skin marker, a remote controller and a laminated card to standardise the device before use.
The vein scanner uses near-ultra red light to highlight blood vessels, the light is safe on the eyes.</p>
