<p>February 2017 will mark a decade since the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act was signed into law. Designed to stimulate the adoption of electronic health records and promote the meaningful use of health information technology, the HITECH Act ushered in the rapid adoption of EHR systems across the healthcare landscape. For many clinicians, the learning curve of exactly what they needed in an EHR hit high gear between 2009 and 2014.</p><h3>A Decade of Learning</h3><p>Clinical teams and their HIT requirements have evolved since the early days of mandated EHR adoption. Technology has also evolved bringing smart mobile devices, patient data sharing, application interoperability, and new levels of integration. These advances allow clinicians and their teams to optimize patient encounters, reduce costs, and increase patient satisfaction with care delivery.</p><h3>Beyond the EHR</h3><p>Beyond the EHR, billing and practice management solutions have evolved as have the ways that these systems and patient databases are managed and where they are stored. Cloud computing and hosting solutions have gained traction in the last decade offering practices more options than ever before in how and where their critical patient management systems will be housed.</p>
