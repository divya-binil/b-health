<p>At the beginning of the pandemic, we wrote a lot about how the pandemic should and could be handled. In addition to providing real-world advice on what technology can do to support us (like <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/digital-health-apps-to-use-during-the-covid-19-quarantine">Digital Health Apps To Use During Quarantine</a> or <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/the-sober-state-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-fight-against-covid-19">The State of A.I. in the Fight Against COVID-19</a>), we often provided forecasts (<a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/when-and-how-will-covid-19-end">When And How Will COVID End?</a>) and predictions about the management and the potential outcome of the epidemic (<a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/will-there-be-a-second-wave-of-covid-19">Will There Be A Second Wave</a>). We even created <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/the-medical-futurist-handbook-to-fight-against-the-covid-19-pandemic">an entire handbook</a> to give away for free!</p>
