<p>Doceree, a global network of HCP-only platforms for programmatic messaging raises $11M in Series A funding round led by Eight Roads Ventures.<br><br>Founded in 2019 by Harshit, a former physician who transitioned into the healthcare marketing space, Doceree empowers life sciences brands and media agencies with solutions that seamlessly reach HCPs on professional HCP networks and within their digital workflow to achieve better patient health outcomes.
On the back of the massive interest of pharma brands and publishers towards Doceree’s custom-built product offerings within the programmatic pharma marketing space, the company expanded to key international locations, such as emerging markets in the UK &amp; Europe, within two years of the platform’s launch in the U.S. The sophistication of Doceree’s platform capabilities has created enormous opportunities for marketers and publishers in these geographies as it transforms the way pharma brands communicate with HCPs globally on physician-only platforms.
“It is critical for industry players like life sciences companies and HCP-only platforms to understand and react to the digital touchpoints and behaviors of HCPs for delivering messages they resonate with,” says Harshit Jain, M.D., Founder &amp; Global CEO, Doceree.</p>
