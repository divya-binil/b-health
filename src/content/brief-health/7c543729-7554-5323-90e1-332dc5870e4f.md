<p>ORLANDO, Fla. – Microsoft has announced advancements in cloud technologies for healthcare and life sciences with the general availability of Azure Health Data Services and updates to Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare.</p><p>Combined with the recent close of its acquisition of Nuance Communications, Microsoft seeks to amplify healthcare organizations' ability to help others by leveraging artificial intelligence to address the biggest challenges transforming the future of healthcare.</p><h2><strong>Interoperability for better outcomes and clinical advances</strong></h2><p>The goal of Azure Health Data Services is interoperability that drives better patient outcomes and clinical advances. The health industry generates an overwhelming amount of data, much of which is unstructured and inaccessible. Oftentimes, this data sits in silos and is not used to its full potential.</p><p>Within that data lies the power to deliver better patient care and outcomes, provide&nbsp;further clinical advances&nbsp;and accelerate research breakthroughs, Microsoft said. The key to unlocking the data is interoperability across the entire health ecosystem. Microsoft took a step to address health data interoperability with Azure API for FHIR in 2019. The company's next evolution of that journey is&nbsp;Azure Health Data Services.</p>
