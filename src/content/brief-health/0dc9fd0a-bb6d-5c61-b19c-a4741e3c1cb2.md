<p>What You Should Know:</p><p>– Tyto Care announces the launch of its fingertip Pulse Oximeter device, allowing users to measure their own blood oxygen saturation level and heart rate from the comfort and safety of home.</p><p>– Expanding its clinic-quality remote capabilities, TytoCare users will be able to perform a remote blood oxygen exam, allowing clinicians to better monitor patients with COVID-19 and chronic lung or heart conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tytocare.com/">Tyto Care</a>, a New York City-based all-in-one modular device and examination platform for AI-powered, on-demand, remote medical exams, today announced the release of its FDA-cleared fingertip Pulse Oximeter (SpO2) medical device. The Pulse Oximeter enables TytoCare users to check blood oxygen saturation levels and heart rate, which are crucial for the monitoring of chronic conditions and <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/coronavirus-covid-19/">COVID-19</a>.</p><p><strong>Fingertip At-Home Pulse Oximeter Measures Blood Oxygen and Heart Rate</strong></p><p>The Pulse Oximeter connects by cable to the TytoCare device. Users who choose to perform the blood oxygen exam are prompted to place their finger in the&nbsp;SpO2&nbsp;device for 15 seconds. Upon completion of the exam, the blood oxygen and heart rate results appear immediately on the handheld TytoCare device and the Pulse Oximeter adaptor itself and are also recorded within the TytoCare platform for review by the clinician and sent to the patients’ <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/category/emr-ehr/">EHR (Electronic Health Record)</a>. If the examination is performed in real-time during a live telehealth visit, the clinician will see the results immediately in the TytoCare Clinician Dashboard. Clinicians are able to assess the reliability of the results recorded by viewing the heart rhythm graph generated during the exam.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
