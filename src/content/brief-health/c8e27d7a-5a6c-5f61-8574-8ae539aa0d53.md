<p>Since the current economic headwinds are difficult, we decided to take a brief break to zoom out and consider some of the more distant patterns that are encouraging. In particular, the pace of healthcare innovation has accelerated significantly as a result of significant injections of venture capital in recent years as well as the passing of a number of significant milestones. Here, we list some of them and offer some thoughts, opportunities, and follow-up questions. Recent advancements have enabled the "modularization" of health technology, just as AWS democratised access to online data storage and cloud computing and Shopify expedited and ubiquitized online retail. This simply means that "plug and play" is becoming more accessible.</p>
