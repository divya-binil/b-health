<p>Taking a cue from other digitally mature industries, like retail, travel and financial services, hospitals, too, have taken on improving patient experience at every touchpoint, even before the visit commences all the way through follow-up care.
According to a recent Deloitte-Scottsdale Institute survey, “Most survey respondents are hoping to achieve better patient experience (92%) as the top desired outcome from digital transformation.” Hospitals are using the automation stack for both nonvertical processes like staffing and running IT helpdesks and for vertical processes such as physician credentialing or verifying insurance eligibility. At Pre-Registration: As much information about the patient and their insurance as possible can be collected before any service commences. Hospitals are home to a number of applications for carrying out myriad tasks, from patient scheduling and settling payments to electronic health record management and verifying insurance claims.
As healthcare matures to value-based care being delivered to patients wherever they are, every process along the delivery chain will have to be explored for automation potential.
