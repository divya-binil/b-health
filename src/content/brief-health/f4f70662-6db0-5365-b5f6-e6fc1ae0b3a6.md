<p>The lack of reliable internet access is a factor consistently associated with high risk of death from COVID-19, according to a study published March 4 in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789619"><i>JAMA Network Open</i></a>.</p><p>University of Chicago researchers analyzed data on social determinants of health and COVID-19 mortality across 3,142 counties in 50 states from Jan. 22, 2020-Feb. 28, 2021. They found the lack of internet access was consistently linked to high COVID-19 mortality risk, regardless of other demographic factors such as age, education and insurance status.</p><p>For every additional 1 percent of residents in a county who have internet access, it is estimated that between 2.4 and six COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people could be prevented, according to the study.</p><p>"We believe this finding suggests that more awareness is needed about the essential asset of technological access to reliable information, remote work, schooling opportunities, resource purchasing and/or social community," the researchers wrote. "Populations with limited internet access remain understudied and are often excluded in pandemic research."</p>
