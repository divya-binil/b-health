<p>Recently, two significant changes in the difficult status of health care were thoroughly examined in front of the public. They seem to reflect at least a partial resolution to the issue Massachusetts shares with most other states given their clear overlap. Gov. Charlie Baker stated at the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans conference last week that the health care sector needs to reconsider how it provides services in light of the ongoing staffing shortages. The Massachusetts Health &amp; Hospital administration calculated that there were roughly 19,000 full-time openings at the hospitals throughout the commonwealth in October. Health care payments are also impacted by the staffing shortages, according to Baker. Patients are left waiting in place as they wait for a spot in their next treatment centre because understaffed rehabilitation and long-term care facilities are unable to accept new patients from hospitals.</p>
