<p>How did Joe turn March 2020, his worst sales month ever, into April 2020, his best sales month ever - despite the pandemic? Well, building a successful business during a pandemic takes a little bit of luck, a whole lot of creativity, and the skill to see the potential in every situation. From hiring the right teams to pivoting during times of uncertainty, every decision you make is a “make-or-break” decision - especially when the market is in turmoil. This has been Joe Brown’s life for the past 3 years and, during the pandemic, when other startups were shutting down, he built a “faster horse.” Communication, asking questions - of your customers and yourself - and understanding the value of social proof in today’s digital healthcare solutions are just the beginning. Tune in for Joe’s incredible story.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
