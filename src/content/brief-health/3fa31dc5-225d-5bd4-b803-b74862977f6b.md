<p>In order to offer in-home drug therapy management to Medicare beneficiaries, Signify Health has established a partnership with Cardinal Health, a supplier of medicines and medical devices. Signify's mobile network of 11,000 credentialed clinicians will be able to offer medication management services for health plan members through in-home health evaluations and identify and address patients' medication needs via Cardinal Health's OutcomesTM platform in order to provide a more coordinated care experience and assist members with their frequently complex medication regimens. Signify Health is able to use the OutcomesOneTM platform to identify and address the pharmaceutical therapy management needs of members by drawing on the information acquired during in-home assessments. The partnership's initial focus will be on addressing interventions suggested for Medicare Advantage members of joint clients, with the possibility of expanding into additional services.</p>
