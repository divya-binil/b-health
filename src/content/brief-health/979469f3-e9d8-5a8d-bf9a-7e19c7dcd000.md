<p>“Andrew’s impressive experience and expertise in healthcare transformation will help further Babylon’s mission as we build an integrated digital first primary care service that can manage global population health at scale.” Following his tenure with the NHS, Hine joined KPMG where he established and led its UK healthcare business as a consulting partner for 13 years, leading client engagements across the UK, Europe and the Middle East, particularly focusing on the strategic design, operational improvement and leadership of health services, organizations and systems.
“I believe Babylon is making a significant impact within the healthcare space by providing better quality, more convenient, and lower cost care globally.”
Babylon is also working with governments, health providers, employers and insurers across the globe to provide them with a new infrastructure that any partner can use to deliver high-quality healthcare with lower costs and better outcomes.</p>
