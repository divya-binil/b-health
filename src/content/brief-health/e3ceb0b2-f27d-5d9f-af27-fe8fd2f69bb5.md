<p>Peter Micca, audit and assurance partner and national health tech leader at Deloitte, discusses the health tech funding and economic environment. According to Peter Micca, audit and assurance partner and national health tech leader at Deloitte, despite a decline in health tech investment last year, there is still a great demand for innovation in the healthcare industry. Micca had a conversation with MobiHealthNews about the consulting company's most recent study on the state of the health technology investment landscape and the expanding significance of platform-enabled ecosystems. What are some of the key lessons you've learned from the funding of health technology in 2022 and the first half of 2023, asks MobiHealthNews? Peter Micca: Both public exits and funding are declining. It focuses on fewer, stronger businesses that have a clear value proposition, have shown a return on investment, and are prepared to scale. And prices have decreased.</p>
