<p>Researchers found a 43.4% mean reduction in patient-rated obsessive-compulsive symptoms.<br><br>A teletherapy program reduced symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, and most patients maintained improvements up to a year later, according to a study published in JMIR.
The treatment, from digital mental health company NOCD, included twice-weekly video appointments that used exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy for three weeks.
"Technology assistance likely played an important role in this treatmentâ€™s ability to both engage and treat a large number of patients in wide-ranging geographic locations and to achieve a high mean rate of symptom improvement and a high rate of treatment response," they wrote.</p>
