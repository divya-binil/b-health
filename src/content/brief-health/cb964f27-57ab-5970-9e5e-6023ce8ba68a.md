<p>As data specialists, it is imperative that we regularly assess and limit our exposure to malware and other dangers. The easiest way to do this is to address data protection on multiple levels. In this podcast, Andy Stone, CTO of Pure Storage for the Americas, talks about how Pure Storage can assist businesses in being prepared and recovering from a ransomware assault. Prior: Use a robust architecture to stay one step ahead of attackers. Before a hacker encrypts and starts an assault, you can find anomalies with Pure Storage products by performing quick analytics on a centralised data hub. Pure SafeMode locks and secures data so they can't be removed, providing you piece of mind even while the invader can still access and encrypt your data.</p>
