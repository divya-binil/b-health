<p>A recent survey by the American Nurses Association reports 51 percent of nurses feel overwhelmed, 76 percent report exhaustion and burnout, and nurse-to-patient workloads have tripled.
But EHR systems have fallen far short of their promise – leading to clinician stress and burnout and less time for interaction with patients.
EHR design and use issues – such as information overload, excessive data entry, note bloat, an inability to navigate the system quickly and a fear of missing something – were listed as some of the primary reasons for “high clinician stress.” On top of 12 hours shifts, nurses often need to spend an extra hour or more completing non-intuitive shift change paperwork.</p>
