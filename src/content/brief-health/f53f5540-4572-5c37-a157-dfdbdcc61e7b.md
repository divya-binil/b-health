<p>The basics of A.I. – how artificial intelligence disrupts healthcare, and what more it can do to make everything better.<br><br>A doctor in China uses a machine learning algorithm to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/chinese-hospitals-deploy-ai-help-diagnose-covid-19/">detect signs of pneumonia</a> associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections on images from lung CT scans. Epidemiologists in Canada are using the technology <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-epidemiologist-wuhan-public-health-warnings/">to monitor the spread of a disease</a> and help prevent outbreaks. In the U.S., researchers are using artificial intelligence for <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/network-medicine-in-the-fight-against-covid-19/">more efficient drug discovery</a>. Elsewhere around the world, patients are turning to their phones to access <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/top-12-health-chatbots/">symptom checkers</a> leveraging smart algorithms.</p><p>These instances where medical professionals and patients alike employ artificial intelligence (A. I.) are already happening but in the coming years will be even more commonplace. However, as the technology becomes ubiquitous at a heightened pace, understanding how it works and explaining its deductions becomes increasingly challenging.&nbsp;</p>
