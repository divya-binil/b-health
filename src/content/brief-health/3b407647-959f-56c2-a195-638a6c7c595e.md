<p>Esteemed experts in digital health, healthcare policy and technology will share insights, exchange ideas and discuss strategies for advancing digital health in Europe at the Digital Health Advisory Group for Europe (DHAGE) high-level meeting during the HIMSS23 European Health Conference and Exhibition. HIMSS23 Europe, a premier conference for healthcare and technology experts, will provide as a forum for DHAGE to explore and influence the future of digital health in the area from June 7â€“9 in Lisbon, Portugal. Healthcare professionals may register for HIMSS23 Europe now with a variety of flexible choices. DHAGE, a thought leadership platform for influential European decision-makers, finds intersections and fosters teamwork on digital health regulations. Building on the work of the HIMSS European Conference Advisory Council, DHAGE was developed by HIMSS in partnership with the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health with the aim of developing policy subjects of national relevance for its member countries. The DHAGE meeting will offer a venue for engaging conversations, interactive activities, and networking opportunities, encouraging communication and cooperation.</p>
