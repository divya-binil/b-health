<p>IBM introduced the Simon Personal Communicator (SPC) towards the beginning of the 1990s. The SPC was the first touchscreen phone, capable of sending and receiving emails and faxes, and is often regarded as the first smartphone.1 In 30 years, cellphones will have advanced to the point that they may serve as mobile health devices and aid in the diagnosis of life-threatening conditions like cancer and heart disease. We had a conversation with Savan Devani, the founder and CEO of BioTrillion, a San Francisco-based startup that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to use digital indicators to apply smartphone and mobile health technology to human physiology. We learned about the difficulties in creating digital biomarkers and their advantages in enhancing healthcare accessibility for anybody, anytime, everywhere.</p>
