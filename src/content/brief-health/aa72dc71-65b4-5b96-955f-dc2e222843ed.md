<p>So what exactly is the relationship between precision medicine and predictive analytics? How do we get from personalizing care at the individual level?&nbsp;<br><br><i>Prakash Menon is the CEO at </i><a href="http://www.basehealth.com/"><i>Basehealth</i></a><i>, a science and technology leader that adds genomic precision to predictive analytics and population health management.</i></p><p>Let’s not bury the lead. It’s finally possible to effectively model diseases and predict risk, based on an individual’s unique clinical, lifestyle, environmental and genetic data. True predictive analytics for healthcare have arrived at long last.</p><p><strong>Back to The Future</strong></p><p>Historical medical information that resides in claims data, <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/category/emr-ehr/">electronic medical records</a> (EMRs), and elsewhere has enduring value, but that data remains, by definition, anchored in the past. EMRs, for example, give us a much better view of what happened than what is happening now or what will happen next.</p>
