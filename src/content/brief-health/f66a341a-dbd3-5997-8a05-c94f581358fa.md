title: Download These Medical Apps for iOS This Week - iMedicalApps
---

Hundreds of medical apps for healthcare providers and patients are released each week. We’re committed to picking the most useful ones for medical professionals as they come along. Here are our picks for the must-download medical apps for iOS.

And don’t forget to see what we thought were the best medical apps in 2018.

Quirk CBT
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is widely prescribed for depression, panic disorders, and anxiety. Quirk empowers CBT users by offering an easy-to-use template to challenge negative thoughts and retrain the brain. After downloading the app, one can record a thought, label it with multiple cognitive distortion tags, challenge the validity of the thought, and then create an alternative thought. Entries are saved by date within the app. This enables users to quickly reference recurring thoughts and share with providers. By cataloging thoughts, patterns can emerge and be more effectively treated. For those that code, the app is open source under the GPL.
