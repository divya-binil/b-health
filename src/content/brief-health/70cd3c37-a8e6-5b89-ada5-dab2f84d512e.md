<p>Seed grants ‘represent a starting point for taking innovative, reliable, and scientifically tested digital health applications from bench to bedside,’ says Guilherme Del Fiol, M.D., Ph.D., co-director of the university’s Digital Health Initiative. Seed funding has been awarded to seven University of Utah Health initiatives that could encourage the creation and deployment of more scientifically based digital health apps in routine healthcare. According to Guilherme Del Fiol, M.D., Ph.D., co-director of the university's Digital Health Initiative (DHI) and a professor in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at U of U Health, the grants, which are funded by the university, will concentrate on projects designed to produce safer and more efficient digital tools than those that are currently available. The GApp Lab, which houses more than 35 graduate students and employees working on medical games and apps, and ReImagine EHR, which is utilising the evolution of EHRs into platforms for third-party innovations using interoperability frameworks like the FHIR, SMART, and HL7, are two places where DHI draws on the expertise.</p>
