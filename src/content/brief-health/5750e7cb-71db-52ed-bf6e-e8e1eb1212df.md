<ul><li>Fully integrated, enterprise surgery platform empowers surgeons and hospital teams to significantly improve patient outcomes, efficiency, proficiency of care teams and profitability of surgical service lines with unique data-driven surgery approach</li><li>Platform integrates all of Caresyntax’s market-leading solutions to enable seamless surgical pathways</li><li>This reduces unwarranted surgical variation across pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative workflows</li></ul><p><strong>Berlin, 2nd May 2022.</strong> Caresyntax, the leading vendor of data-driven surgery solutions to make surgery smarter and safer, today announced the launch of its new end-to-end, fully integrated platform. This platform integrates the company’s market-leading data and AI solutions into one seamless surgical pathway that reduces unwarranted surgical variation from pre-operation to post-operation. It also includes a powerful new collaboration capability, which allows remote clinical experts to remotely “scrub-in” into any operating room.</p><p><strong>Dennis Kogan, Caresyntax Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO</strong>: “We are excited about the launch of the end-to-end integrated platform, which seamlessly integrates our powerful AI and data capabilities into one comprehensive SaaS solution, and the new remote collaboration functionality that comes with it. This represents another important strategic milestone as we continue to deliver on our mission of making surgery smarter and safer through technology, to improve patient outcomes, enhance operational efficiency, and increase profitability.”</p><p>The new integrated platform collects, tracks, and evaluates relevant data within one system, enabling users to identify variability and set benchmarks, investigate past surgical cases to implement change, and allow hospital teams to continuously monitor results. For the first time, a complete workstream, data pool and powerful analytics will be available on one platform. With the new remote collaboration and benchmarking functionality, geographical boundaries between experts will be removed, enabling surgeons to operate together and benefit from knowledge and experience across the world.</p><p><strong>Björn von Siemens, Caresyntax Co-Founder and Chief Business Officer:</strong> “Our new integrated platform is another key example of how innovation and technology can fundamentally transform and enhance surgical processes and advance healthcare, by empowering surgeons and hospitals with real-time guidance, data, and powerful insights. The new remote collaboration functionality will further enhance the digital safety net we are building, as it expands a surgeon’s digital support system to a large pool of specialists worldwide and solves key pain points in collaborative surgery.”</p><p><strong>About Caresyntax</strong></p><p>Caresyntax is on a mission to make surgery smarter and safer. Our enterprise-grade data-driven surgery platform delivers actionable insights to improve patient outcomes by using proprietary software and AI to analyze large volumes of video, audio, images, device data, clinical, and operational data in and around the OR. This real-world evidence can be used by the care team live, during a procedure and accessed by those outside the operating room via the platform’s dedicated telehealth link. After a procedure, the Caresyntax platform provides insights that help: surgeons benchmark and improve their care, hospital administrators use surgical resources more efficiently, medical device companies advance better products, and insurance companies understand risk and devise more tailored policies. Headquartered in Boston, Caresyntax software is used in more than 2,800 operating rooms worldwide and supports surgical teams in over three million procedures per year.
