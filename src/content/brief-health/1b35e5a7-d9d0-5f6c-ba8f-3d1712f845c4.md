title: Could sensor technology address CCTV privacy concerns in care homes?
---

Health tech startup says AI solution could offer peace of mind to families of elderly people. Health secretary Matt Hancock recently gave backing to a newspaper campaign calling for CCTV to be made compulsory in elderly care homes.

But privacy concerns have been raised by regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC) around using surveillance in a residential setting.   

“Where and when such technology is being used, consideration must be given to important matters such as individual rights to privacy and dignity,” said Kate Terroni, chief inspector of adult social care at the CQC.

Sensor technology combined with artificial intelligence (AI) has been suggested as one solution that could flag up health issues, while not invading residents’ privacy.

Internet of Things (IoT) sensors could be used as an alternative to CCTV to track unusual patient behaviour, such as when an elderly person has not moved for a long time, said Helen Dempster, chief visionary officer of health tech startup, Karantis360.

“Combined with an AI algorithm, once a pattern has been confirmed, care providers can immediately spot any behavioural changes that fall outside the norm or problems which could indicate potential medical issues,” she added.
