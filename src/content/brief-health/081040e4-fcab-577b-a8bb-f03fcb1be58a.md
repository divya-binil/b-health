<p>Compared to paper files, electronic health records (EHRs) have facilitated quicker and more accurate communication among healthcare providers, but they are nonetheless <a href="https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/clinical-it/news/13030577/survey-physicians-cite-ehrs-as-biggest-contributor-to-burnout">often cited</a> as a leading cause of physician burnout. After analyzing several studies on medical record-caused fatigue, a group of researchers came up with <a href="https://news.ufl.edu/2021/03/physician-burnout/">four key recommendations</a> that they believe healthcare organizations could implement to curb burnout.</p><p>Lisa Merlo, Ph.D., an associate professor of psychiatry and director of wellness programs at the University of Florida College of Medicine, teamed up with Oliver Nguyen, a research coordinator and IT specialist in the College of Medicine, to evaluate 35 studies of records-related burnout, looking for common threads. Their study, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jamia/ocaa339/6124800?login=true">published in the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association</a>, is part of a special issue on physician burnout.</p>
