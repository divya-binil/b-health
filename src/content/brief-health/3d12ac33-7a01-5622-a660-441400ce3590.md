<p>LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SteadyMD, a B2B telehealth infrastructure provider that powers high-quality telehealth patient experiences for leaders and innovators in healthcare, is pleased to share insights from a sample of more than 1,700 doctors, nurses and therapists to better understand what is motivating them to pursue telehealth opportunities.
The analysis categorized participant responses according to both clinician type and years of practice, revealing that doctors with 15 or more years of experience expressed the highest interest in telehealth, and seasoned therapists followed closely behind 86% of whom view telehealth as an opportunity to work more night shifts and supplement the income from their day jobs.
The report also showed that nearly two-thirds (63%) of the clinician responses confirmed that they would welcome a full-time telehealth role, if the opportunity presented itself.
Nurse practitioners are very interested in full-time careers as telehealth clinicians and are open to a variety of shifts that fit within their ideal work schedule.
“Overall, our analysis shows that many clinicians are looking to telehealth as a full-time, dependable alternative to their more traditional medical roles, while others are interested in the ‘side hustle’ that virtual care makes possible,” said Guy Friedman, CEO of SteadyMD. SteadyMD is a B2B telehealth infrastructure provider that powers high-quality telehealth patient experiences for leaders and innovators in healthcare in all 50 states.</p>
