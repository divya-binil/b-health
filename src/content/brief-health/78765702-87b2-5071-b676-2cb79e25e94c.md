<p>The COVID-19 vaccines certainly aren't the first inoculations to require multiple doses to achieve maximum efficacy. Patients trying to receive full protection against shingles, human papillomavirus and other illnesses also need to get at least two jabs. A&nbsp;recent survey suggests individuals aren't the best at getting them.</p><p>A poll released <a href="https://drfirst.com/press-releases/covid-vaccine-alert-drfirst-survey-forget-second-dose-vaccines/">this past month</a> from DrFirst found that 43% of respondents said they had received a vaccine in the past requiring multiple doses. But 13% said they did not get the second dose, or weren't sure if they did so. Residents cited numerous reasons for missing the follow-up dose, including failing to receive a reminder from their provider,&nbsp;not realizing they needed additional doses,&nbsp;missing the appointment,&nbsp;or just plain forgetting. &nbsp;</p><p>DrFirst, which provides technology solutions for healthcare organizations, notes that the gaps illustrated in the survey could lead to diminished effectiveness in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.&nbsp;</p>
