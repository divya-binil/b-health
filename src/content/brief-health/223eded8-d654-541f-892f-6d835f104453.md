<p>Mental health has always had a challenging place in healthcare.&nbsp; First, it has suffered from an extreme amount of stigma (and still does) that has caused many people to avoid getting the mental health care they need.&nbsp; Second, (and possibly because of the stigma) we don’t have nearly enough mental health providers out there to service everyone that needs help.&nbsp; Plus, the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns have driven almost all of us to question our mental health state at some point in the last year.&nbsp; While many of these COVID related mental health problems don’t rise to the point that they need professional help, many do.</p><p>It’s not hard to see where this is headed.&nbsp; Lots of people with mental health issues and not enough mental health providers to care for those in need.&nbsp; I know the value of professional mental health on a number of levels.&nbsp; When I first started working in healthcare I worked at a health and counseling center that tried to treat the patient across health and mental health.&nbsp; The team did a phenomenal job taking care of every aspect of a person’s wellness.&nbsp; While I saw the impact of this type of coordinated effort, I also saw that it was time consuming work to do it effectively.</p>
