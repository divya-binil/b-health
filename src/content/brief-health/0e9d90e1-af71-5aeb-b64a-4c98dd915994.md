<p>An expert offers an overview of AR and VR for provider organizations, and discusses what these leading-edge technologies might help hospitals health systems accomplish. Virtual reality and the so-called metaverse are emerging technologies that have a lot to offer the healthcare industry. Before using them on actual patients, surgeons can evaluate the efficacy of novel surgical techniques in the metaverse. Also, as an extension of telehealth, medical providers can access patients electronically and conduct virtual examinations. What is the metaverse, exactly? How is virtual reality implemented? What could they offer in terms of healthcare? And what new developments will these technologies bring in the years to come? We spoke with Pari Natarajan, CEO of Zinnov, a worldwide management and consulting company specialising in digital transformation in healthcare, to obtain answers to these issues.</p>
