<p>Bill Siwicki examines how Houston Methodist nurses are using software to increase the completion rates of advance care plans (ACPs) in the Global Edition of Patient Engagement. The impact of this nurse-facilitated technology is enormous, especially when used in patients' homes. The use of this software, according to the Senior Vice President of Population Health and Primary Care, has increased the proportion of ACP completion among men and persons of colour over national averages. Houston Methodist is effectively involving patients and ensuring that their preferences and healthcare choices are recorded in ACPs by utilising this technology. Software has proven to be an effective tool for empowering patients and encouraging inclusion in healthcare decision-making in this situation.&nbsp;</p>
