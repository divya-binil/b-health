<p>GlobalData uncovers the leading innovators in 3D endoscopy for the medical devices industry. The demand for homecare, preventative care, early diagnosis, speeding up patient recovery, increasing outcomes, and the importance of technologies like machine learning, augmented reality, 5G, and digitalization all continue to drive innovation in the medical device sector. According to GlobalData's report on Artificial Intelligence in Medical Devices: 3D Endoscopy, there have been over 450,000 patents applied for and issued in the medical devices sector in just the previous three years alone. However, not all innovations are created equally, nor do they always advance. Instead, their evolution resembles an S-shaped curve that depicts their usual lifetime of early emergence, accelerated acceptance, stabilisation, and maturation.</p>
