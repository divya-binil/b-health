  <p>Patients should be at the center when designing digital health experiences
  for several reasons:</p><p>Patient-Centered Care: Designing digital health
  experiences with patients at the center ensures that the care provided is
  patient-centered. This means that the needs, preferences, and goals of the
  patient are considered throughout the design process. Patient-centered care
  has been shown to improve patient satisfaction, health outcomes, and reduce
  healthcare costs.</p><p>User Experience: Patients are the end-users of digital
  health experiences, and their input is crucial for creating a positive user
  experience. Involving patients in the design process helps to identify
  usability issues and create solutions that are intuitive and easy to use. This
  can lead to increased engagement and adherence to treatment
  plans.</p><p>Personalization: Digital health experiences that are designed
  with patients at the center can be personalized to the individual needs of
  each patient. This can include personalized treatment plans, reminders, and
  educational resources. Personalization can improve patient engagement and
  adherence to treatment plans, leading to better health
  outcomes.</p><p>Empowerment: Patients who are involved in the design process
  are empowered to take an active role in their healthcare. This can lead to
  increased patient satisfaction and better health outcomes. Patients who feel
  heard and valued are more likely to be engaged in their healthcare and take an
  active role in their treatment.</p><p>Overall, involving patients in the
  design process of digital health experiences is essential for creating
  patient-centered care, improving user experience, personalization, and
  empowering patients. By prioritizing patient input, healthcare organizations
  can create digital health experiences that are effective, efficient, and meet
  the needs of patients.</p>

<p>Patients should be the focus, but developers need to consider the entire healthcare ecosystem too – including physicians and healthcare workers, said panelists at HIMSS23.</p><p>CHICAGO –&nbsp;Creating a seamless experience is key when it comes to improving patients' interactions with the healthcare system, said Andrea Marks, vice president of digital transformation at Walmart Health and Wellness.</p><p>It's great to solve one step in the process –&nbsp;like scheduling an appointment –&nbsp;but patients are frustrated when they need to move from app to app to access all their care needs.&nbsp;</p><p>"A digital experience that is integrated, interconnected, where people don't have to jump around. You can learn more from them, they're more engaged, and they just feel like you know them. And you're not kind of passing them from one group to the next," Marks said at HIMSS23.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/patients-should-be-center-when-designing-digital-health-experiences">Read on mobihealthnews.com</a></p>
