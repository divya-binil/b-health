<p>For International Nurses Day 2021, read Gemma Dakin's experiences and how she was inspired to become a Digital Pioneer Fellow.<br><br>Gemma Dakin is a project support officer for the Digital Transformation and Technology team at the Health Innovation Network (HIN) which she combines with one day a week as a nurse at The London Clinic. For International Nurses Day 2021 she shares her experience so far and how she was inspired to become a Digital Pioneer Fellow.</p><p><strong>Working on the wards after graduating</strong></p><p>I was eager to graduate and start my first job as a Registered Nurse in Major Trauma and Orthopaedics at Leeds General Infirmary (LGI). Every day, patients came in with severe and traumatic injuries and my small team of healthcare professionals had the responsibility of caring for them. This job required me to be efficient at wound care management, pain control and medication administration. I learnt to operate in high pressured and critical situations, which demanded professional competency, excellent communication skills and strong teamwork.</p>
