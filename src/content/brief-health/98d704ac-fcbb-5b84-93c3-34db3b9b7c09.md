<p>Medical IoT devices have become essential for the healthcare industry to carry out many of its day-to-day responsibilities. From helping to stop the spread of COVID-19 throughout this year to assisting ambulances, this industry relies heavily on technology to get the job done. Unfortunately, connecting IoT or IoMT devices to an IT network expands the attack surface, and many hospitals are still running on older network systems. This adds new entry points for hackers to target.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
