<p>Hospitals, portrayed as the "good guys" in the health care debate, are actually centers of greed and poor patient care, where a "good ole boys club" of top dogs, CEOs making millions, and handpicked yes-men control everything and maximize the bottom line through unnecessary tests, procedures, and surgeries, leading to medical errors, and stifle independent-minded doctors through a rigged "peer review" system, all while hiding behind their non-profit status. If the public and policymakers do not raise the issue of hospitals' place in the current health care discussion, they may be missing the boat. The hospitals have painted themselves as the "good guys" who recruit and retain skilled medical professionals and advance the field of excellent medicine. They present themselves as the foundation of neighbourhoods. Yet, the Institute of Medicine found in 1999 that 98,000 hospital deaths were the result of medical mistakes. According to the IOM, medical errors caused 250,000 deaths in hospitals in 2016. Are the public and elected officials paying attention to these figures? They should read this article, I strongly advise. The truth is that hospitals are hotbeds of colossal corporate egos, avarice, favouritism, and frequently subpar patient care.</p>
