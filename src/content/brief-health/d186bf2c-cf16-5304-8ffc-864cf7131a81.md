title: Chinese government releases public app to gauge potential coronavirus exposures
---

As cases of the COVID-19 (the novel coronavirus) continue to spread across China and beyond, the Chinese government has released a new app intended to help citizens check whether they came into contact with the virus. 

App users are asked to register a phone number, name and ID number in or to see if they were in contact with someone infected, according to Chinese state media outlet Xinhua, which first reported the story. 

Users are able to get the app by scanning a QR code through platforms like WeChat, Alipay and QQ. The app will then give them information on whether they came into “close contact” with the disease, which the government defines as being in a close distance to someone with no protection who has a confirmed case or a suspected case. 

The tool will act as a way of collecting data as well as to educate citizens on what to do if they have been in close contact with the virus — which is to stay at home and get advice from health authorities.
