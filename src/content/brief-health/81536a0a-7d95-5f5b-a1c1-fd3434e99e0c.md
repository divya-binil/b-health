At the same time, the sophistication of cyberattacks was continuing to increase.</p><p><i>Healthcare IT News</i> interviewed Christophe&nbsp;Dor√©, cybersecurity manager at Capsule Technologies, a vendor of medical data technologies for healthcare organizations. He described the state of cybersecurity in healthcare during the pandemic, and what provider organizations should expect this year.</p>
