<p>The Sync for Genes program, launched by ONC in 2017 in partnership with the National Institutes of Health’s All of Us Research Program, aims to enable the sharing of standardized genomic information among laboratories, providers, patients, and researchers by advancing the development and use of industry-supported standards, such as the Health Level Seven International® (HL7®) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources® (FHIR®) standard.
Sync for Genes Phase 4 goal was to advance the use of standardized HL7® FHIR®-based APIs in order to improve how genomic information and knowledge could be shared among individuals in clinical and research settings.
To accomplish this, Phase 4 included two demonstration projects and an analysis to identify and prioritize challenges to the exchange and integration of genomic data.
To see how the landscape has changed since Sync for Genes Phase 2, Phase 4 included an analysis that further documented both technical and non-technical challenges to widespread implementation, adoption, and use of genomics standards.
Standards development and content to support the integration and use of genomic data into both clinical and research systems.
The Sync for Genes project, in collaboration with the demonstration sites to date, has primarily focused on the testing and development of interoperable genomics standards and their implementation.</p>
