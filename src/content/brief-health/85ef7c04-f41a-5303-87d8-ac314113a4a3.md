<p>AlertWatch, a patient monitoring technology with FDA clearance and solid clinical data, is acquired by BioIntelliSense, Inc. For more effective, proactive healthcare decisions, AlertWatch offers robust integration, data analysis, and a proprietary intuitive display of contextual patient data. As a new offering in its HealthCastTM portfolio, its Patient Monitoring division will distribute AlertWatch to hospitals across the United States as part of the recently announced strategic alliance with Medtronic. Hospitals around the country are looking for enterprise-grade technologies that automate data gathering, combine it with scalable exception management, and provide clinical insights from the hospital to the home to optimise labor-intensive operations. Four FDA 510(k) clearances for its specific product offerings for the operating room, intensive care unit, and labour and delivery have been granted to AlertWatch over the previous ten years.</p>
