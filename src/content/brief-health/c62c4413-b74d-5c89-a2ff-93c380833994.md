    description: >-
      The Caregility platform spans inpatient and outpatient telemedicine
      settings, with clinical workflow integrations and secure, reliable two-way
      audio and video communication. From within major EMRs and
      telecommunication protocols such as SIP, family members, interpreters, and
      outside clinicians can be added to virtual visits or patient observation
      with a click. Our software is compatible with all major mobile and
      computing devices used in clinical, subacute care, and home environments,
      with 24/7, secure, HIPAA-compliant access. Your patients and clinicians
      deserve nothing less.


      Our simple API set integrates with other applications to enable telehealth
      sessions without complex meeting IDs, passwords, and application
      installations. This software also controls our market-leading patient
      communication/monitoring devices, whether wall or ceiling-mounted, as well
      as mobile carts and tablets.


      Telehealth doesn't exist or operate in a vaccuum. Our focus at Caregility
      is to help you evaluate your current workflows and wrap around the best of
      what you already have. With simplicity comes reduced training and
      onboarding time and costs, as well as improved clinician and patient
      adherence and satisfaction. Benefit from Caregility's combined clinical
      experience and decades of telecommunications heritage.

The companies have teamed together to expand their virtual care capabilities, including Caregility's transformative new Inpatient Virtual Engagement solution (IVE), which offers the industry's first cost-effective option for bedside hybrid care delivery at scale. Inpatient Virtual Engagement will be showcased in the Caregility Booth #1402 at <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3521296-1&amp;h=20515734&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fgotelehealth.org%2Fata-2022%2F%3F__hstc%3D223170372.cc4cf28bb43d723881ec187246e10352.1650552114565.1650552114565.1650552114565.1%26__hssc%3D223170372.1.1650552114565%26__hsfp%3D2674118464&amp;a=ATA2022">ATA2022</a>&nbsp;in Boston from May 1-3.</p><p><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3521296-1&amp;h=55925459&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdwg.com%2Fcontent%2Fcdwg%2Fen%2Findustries%2Fhealthcare-technology.html%3Fcm_mmc%3DVanity-_-healthcare-_-NA-_-012019&amp;a=CDW+Healthcare">CDW Healthcare</a>&nbsp;serves an established provider base, working with a broad range&nbsp;of hospitals and health systems across the U.S., as well as many premier healthcare institutions in the U.K. and Canada. Its wide range of proven solutions and services helps provider organizations to build, refine and grow their virtual care strategy and technology infrastructure – from the hospital to the home.</p><p>"Partnering with Caregility brings an innovative new dimension of hybrid care to the inpatient setting. As healthcare providers reimagine the 'Hospital Room of the Future,' we're giving them a brand-new option to help overcome pervasive staff shortages and burnout, ease clinical workflows and improve the experience for every patient in every room and every bed," says Elliott Wilson, Chief Virtual Care Strategist, CDW Healthcare.</p><p>Powered by the award-winning Caregility Cloud™ virtual care platform, Caregility's IVE solution facilitates hybrid care right at the patient bedside and across all acuity settings. It combines medical-grade telehealth endpoints, cloud-based software and sophisticated device management into an affordable, subscription-based Solution as a Service. At IVE's core are three purpose-built components including the company's new Access Point of Care System (APS100) for lower acuity patient settings, a first-of-its-kind administration portal to centralize multiple virtual care programs, and a fleet management tool for governing thousands of medical-grade telehealth endpoint devices. Health systems can readily scale up or down from one to all beds, depending on the level of acuity needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ­­­</p><p>IVE helps facilitate a breadth of clinical workflows, including virtual specialty coverage, tele-rounding, tele-nursing, and tele-observation to address staffing shortages, streamline patient care, and enhance clinical collaboration. The solution can assist with earlier detection of deteriorating patient conditions, enhancing health systems' ability to support rapid response aimed at improving patient outcomes. IVE also fits into the growing trend of patient engagement, providing patients with timely access to their clinical team, interpreters and family members to reduce anxiety and speed the recovery process.</p><p>"Our partnership with CDW extends the value that we create for our mutual healthcare customers by supporting hybrid care delivery that complements standard inpatient care plans and practices. Together, we aim to help providers improve clinical outcomes, achieve better operational performance and integrate transformative technology solutions into their long-term strategic initiatives," adds Caregility Chief Strategy Officer Pete McLain.</p><p>CDW Healthcare and Caregility will host a live pressroom briefing at the upcoming American Telemedicine Association Annual Conference &amp; Expo in Boston, MA on May 2.</p><p><strong>About CDW&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3521296-1&amp;h=213394710&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdw.com%2F&amp;a=CDW+Healthcare">CDW Healthcare</a>&nbsp;is a leading multi-brand technology solutions provider focused exclusively on serving the healthcare marketplace in North America and the United Kingdom.
