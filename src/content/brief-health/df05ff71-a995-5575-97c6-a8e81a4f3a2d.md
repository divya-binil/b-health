<p>The acquisition will cost $53.5 million in cash, plus an earnout consideration of up to $24 million and around $5 million in stock to employees joining Doximity.<br><br>Doximity, a networking platform for healthcare professionals, has entered into an agreement to acquire on-call physician scheduling and messaging app Amion.
"We're excited to partner with founder Stuart Karon and the Amion team to expand our physician cloud platform," Jeff Tangney, CEO cofounder of Doximity, said in a statement.
Doximity said Amion manages more than 200,000 physician schedules at thousands of hospitals.
"Strategically, Amion adds a key piece to our physician cloud by integrating scheduling alongside our secure messaging, CVs, referrals and telehealth tools," Tangney said.</p>
