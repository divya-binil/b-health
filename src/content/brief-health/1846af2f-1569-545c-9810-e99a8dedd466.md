<p>EmpiricaLab has been chosen to take part in the Techstars Workforce Development Accelerator, a programme aimed at using cutting-edge technology to address the problems of a contemporary dynamic labour market. Over the past ten years, I've personally witnessed how developments in digital health and healthcare analytics hold great promise for enhancing patient outcomes. But if we don't support the teams in charge of adopting and managing them, the technological advancements we've made will be for naught. According to current estimates, the global market for digital health will reach USD 1.5 trillion by 2030, mostly due to rising demand and adoption for remote patient monitoring and easy access to virtual care services. However, there are still issues with employee shortages and burnout among the healthcare workforce.</p>
