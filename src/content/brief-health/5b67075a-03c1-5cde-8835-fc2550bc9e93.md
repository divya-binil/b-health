<p style="text-align: justify;">Before corona hit the world badly, healthcare organizations were operating traditionally. The pandemic situation fueled the technology leverage in the healthcare market that has helped in optimizing healthcare operations, reducing costs, better-managing healthcare data, and handling a diminished healthcare workforce. AI, ML, and NLP technology played a vital role in predictive analytics, drug discovery, imaging diagnostics, and more.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>According to</em> <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/artificial-intelligence-healthcare-market-54679303.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>research</em></a><em>, AI technology usage in the healthcare industry is projected to grow from $14.6 billion in 2023 to $102.7 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 47.6%</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It indicates the rising need for enhanced healthcare services is best met by AI technology as it identifies the pattern and provides automated insights at the flick of a switch. The <a href="https://www.medigy.com/news/2022/09/28/healthleadersmedia-7-ai-based-healthcare-apps-that-save-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare AI-based application</a> AI-based application also saves people time and guarantees the shiny future of the healthcare market. The programming language that makes AI-driven healthcare app development possible is PYTHON. The language unfolds an array of opportunities before the healthcare market to experiment with AI technology leverage through Python.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Python is used by data scientists at scale to resolve the challenges of the healthcare industry due to its capability to build ML algorithms. Python-powered applications are a panacea for the healthcare landscape that’s looking for precise solutions. Still, unsure about Python leverage in healthcare app development, software applications built using Python to improve quality care and patient outcomes will answer. Let’s dive in!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Top 5 reasons to choose python in healthcare app development</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Python developers are hired to get build innovative, AI-powered healthcare applications that help healthcare organizations from data management and security to everything that you can expect. Here the reasons explained in detail why python’s leverage brings the difference.</p>
<h3>Predictive analysis of complex diseases</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nowadays, preventive healthcare is better than curing the disease after it’s found through diagnosis. Traditionally, no system is capable of predicting disease because diseases emerge unexpectedly. ML algorithms are powerful at analyzing genetics and then predicting the disease before it worse the health-related issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Healthcare organizations need to look for the best and <a href="https://www.prismetric.com/hire-python-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire python developers</a> to build ML models that can help with next-generation sequencing techniques development, which is an integral part of medical research. NGS requires huge data sets processing and analysis where ML models can help to predict trends and patterns in health variations to predict diseases. This way, not only does disease detection gets speed up, but the treatment process also gets accelerated followed by risk mitigation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Image-based diagnosis</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Machine learning applications surpass the human brain’s capability of analyzing multiple images simultaneously and providing precise answers during diagnosis. The images can be MRI, DTI, computerized tomography, and more, where ML algorithms excel at analyzing multiple images with more than 92% accuracy rate- that’s crucial during medical surgeries. Here, python plays a vital role in detecting and curing major healthcare-related issues such as-</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Finding and classifying tumors through CAD images.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Detecting cardiovascular abnormalities with auto-assessment of the chest radiograph.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Identification of fractures with medical image analysis and report generation.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Thoracic condition and complication detection with radiology images analysis.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Cancer screening with medical image analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Enhance patient management</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Healthcare organizations with limited staff find it difficult to manage the patient’s appointment scheduling, treatment process, and other things. Expert <a href="https://www.prismetric.com/healthcare-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare app development company</a> make use of programming languages like Python to build solutions that enable healthcare organizations to better manage patients despite having few resources. The enhanced patient management allows staff to focus on core healthcare activities that improve the patient experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Healthcare automation with python applications allows patients to schedule an appointment at their convenience, receive immediate help with real-time chat, request emergency services, ask for drug refills, and upload health-related symptoms at regular intervals for continuous monitoring. It allows healthcare practitioners to provide immediate help that allows patients to stay healthy without visiting the hospital or clinic.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Optimize hospital operations</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Intelligently allocating jobs to the hospital staff is all-important to keep the staff completing their work without being overburdened or sitting idle. Conventionally, staff management for different shifts is a little trickier as the staff jobs are changed as per the demand (Busy days, low admission, and others). Here, Python-backed applications are a boon for data scientists as it facilitates the creation of ML models that can help with staff optimization automatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Machine learning in healthcare organization analyze appointments, patient admission, diagnostic results, and treatment process to identify which shift requires more staff to keep the work going on seamlessly. Staff optimization results in improved hospital operations and better outcomes.</p>
<h3>Clinical research for drug discovery</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Scientists perform in-depth clinical research on the 3D structure of disease and use various tools to discover the right drug. The studies state that python-driven tools have taken drug discovery to the next level by enabling the 3D visualization of disease to gain a better understanding of the root cause of the problem. It helps in designing a new drug that can handle targeted diseases well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the reason python stands out as the best choice for drug discovery tool creation. It can be easily viewed through job portals where most of the job for drug discovery mandates python experience.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Ensure HIPAA compliance</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Python frameworks are known for secure data exchange with other applications, which is a major need in healthcare organizations due to electronic health records (EHR) development. The language perfectly integrates with database and python packages to facilitate cryptography, which ensures data when saved, when shared, and when transferred remains safe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This way python applications for healthcare tick all the boxes required for HIPAA compliance.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">What the future holds for Python in healthcare applications?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and NLP technologies are sure to make healthcare application shine. That’s where python language outshines in making ML models for healthcare solutions. The leading healthcare start-ups such as AiCure, Roam Analytics, Drchrono, Qventus, and Fathom Health are leveraging python frameworks- Django, Flask, and more to build unique solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It facilitates medical data analysis, complex disease forecasting, improved hospital operations, enhanced patient experience, and drug discovery at a rapid pace. Healthcare organizations can get hands-on python features to raise a toast to success.</p>
