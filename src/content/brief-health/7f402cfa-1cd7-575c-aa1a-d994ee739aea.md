<p>The widening gap in access to healthcare between rich and poor can only be bridged with digital health solutions. If they are used wisely.<br><br>This highlights the fact that the health gap is significantly wider between countries than within countries, even if US figures seem shocking at first.
But there is another, often overlooked aspect: the difference between health literacy.
The CDC defines health literacy as: “the degree to which individuals have the ability to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others”.
Brigding the gap with digital health tools
So, what is digital health?
The gap between patients without healthcare access and the number of trained doctors is only going to widen.
And can only be bridged with digital health tools.
We can, however, involve them with remote health tools and A.
This opens up an avenue to globalised healthcare, an accessible, affordable arsenal built by digital health tools.
But this is the next best thing we can come up with for millions and billions of people with currently zero access to health services if we can bridge the gap between the data and the user.
But let’s circle back to the question of health literacy and health gap.
Also, patients with lower health literacy rates are less likely to use the possibilities of eHealth.
Will technological transformation improve health literacy levels, or the contrary: will digital health deepen the already existing digital divide?”</p>
