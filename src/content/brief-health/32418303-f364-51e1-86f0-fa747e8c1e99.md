<p>It was almost exactly a year ago when we first wrote about the <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/covid-19-was-needed-for-telemedicine-to-finally-go-mainstream/">rise of telemedicine</a> amidst COVID-19. Similarly, it was almost a year ago we first brought up the issue of <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/will-medical-workers-deal-with-ptsd-after-covid-19/">PTSD of medical personnel</a> due to the virus. We did not expect the two to intertwine.</p><p>At one point over the past twelve months, we all noticed an extreme level of tiredness after a full workday spent in front of a computer. But it wasn’t tiredness: it was <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fatigue#causes">fatigue</a>. While tiredness can be easily cured with rest and sleep, fatigue is a whole different issue. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5420158/">It may lead</a> to chronic diseases, burnout and ill mental and physical health, and its cure requires way more than just sleeping.</p><p>Now imagine that you stare at a screen all day and your task isn’t yet another excel sheet, email or document, but to cure another human being. And although you experience the same kind of tiredness and fatigue, you can’t give in to it, as the person on the other end of the screen is counting on you as your doctor. That’s troubling.</p>
