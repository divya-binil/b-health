<ul><li>Primary care practices are playing a significant role in vaccinating people in the U.S. for COVID-19, according to a new <a href="http://https//www.pcpcc.org/2021/04/20/primary-care-covid-19-round-28-survey">survey</a> from the Primary Care Collaborative and the Larry A. Green Center.</li><li>The PCC surveyed more than 650 primary care physicians, nurse practitioners and pharmacists in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Guam. Altogether, nearly four out of 10 practices are administering the COVID-19 vaccines, "a marked increase" compared to just a few weeks prior, while 47% are partnering with local vaccination administration sites. "Primary care is now beginning to be leveraged to target the vaccine to hard-to-reach populations," the survey's authors concluded.</li><li>The news comes as practices are <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/1-year-in-independent-primary-care-physicians-more-financially-stable-but/595572/">financially stabilizing</a> more than a year after the pandemic began. However, primary care practices are facing enormous challenges in the near term, including pent-up demand for medical and mental health services and a growing feeling of exhaustion among physicians.</li></ul>
