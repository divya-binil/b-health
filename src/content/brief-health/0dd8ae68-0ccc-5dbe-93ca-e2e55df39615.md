<p>However, using AI in a healthcare setting poses a unique set of ethical and logistical challenges.
MobiHealthNews asked health tech vet Muhammad Babur, a program manager at the Mayo Clinic, about the potential challenges and ethics behind using AI in healthcare ahead of his upcoming discussion at HIMSS22.
As healthcare providers, we cannot allow unchecked AI algorithms to access and analyze huge amounts of data at the expense of patient privacy.
Barbur: Yes, healthcare organizations are held to different standards than other industries because the wrong use of AI in healthcare could cause potential harm to patients and certain demographics.
Because of all these challenges and the potential for improving the health of millions of people around the world, we need to have more stringent safeguards, standards and governance structures around implementing AI for patient care.
Any healthcare organization using AI in a patient care setting or clinical research needs to understand and mitigate ethical and moral issues around AI as well.</p>
