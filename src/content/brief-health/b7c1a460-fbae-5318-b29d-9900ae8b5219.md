<p>Join our discussion about the future and value of data monetization in healthcare with experts Atul Butte, and Jim Stolze.<br><br>As vast amounts of healthcare data continue to pour into electronic health records (EHR), leaders need to understand how we can leverage this information in a regulated and responsible manner to improve patient care and business strategies.
To address these questions, we brought together two experts to explore what our healthcare data is worth â€” Atul Butte, Chief Data Scientist across University of California Health System, and Jim Stolze, Tech Entrepreneur and founder of Aigency.
To understand how data can drive healthcare savings, or monetization, Atul began the session by discussing the vast amounts of data within the single central database of records of the University of California Health System, composed of 8 million patients treated over the past decade.
While many interesting topics such as real-world evidence data, AI training, and integrating genomics data into EHR were discussed, Atul wraps his session by emphasizing that using the data of the health record system can be utilized not to just save money, but provide more clinical options to patients.
The next frontier, Jim explains, is that if healthcare professionals want to become more efficient, &nbsp;there needs to be governance in place with the responsible management of data, algorithms, and AI.
How can healthcare organizations best show the value of data sharing and how it is giving back to patients?
