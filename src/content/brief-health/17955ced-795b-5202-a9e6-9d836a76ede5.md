<p>Implicity released a new SMART on FHIR application to improve interoperability and workflow efficiencies for providers. Implicity, a pioneer in cardiac data management and remote patient monitoring (RPM) solutions, recently unveiled a new SMART on FHIR application to enhance provider workflow efficiency and interoperability. By giving doctors access to Implicity alerts and reports directly within Epic's EHR system, the new tool enhances cardiac remote monitoring processes. By consolidating data from diverse cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) into a single environment, Implicity's cloud-based platform enables cardiac teams to streamline procedures. The system then uses machine learning and AI-based algorithms to analyse data, rank warnings, and oversee administrative and clinical operations. Implicity now offers coverage to more than 70,000 patients in 100 hospitals across the US and Europe. Moreover, academic and clinical researchers use the platform.</p>
