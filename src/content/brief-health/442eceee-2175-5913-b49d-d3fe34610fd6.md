    title: Avery Telehealth
    description: >-
      No one wants to see patients readmitted to the hospital. It increases
      healthcare costs across the board. It's hard on doctors and nurses who are
      spread thin. It's difficult on hospital personnel forced to deal with
      increasing workload. It's viewed as wasteful spending by insurance
      companies and other payers. Most of all, it's tough on patients who spend
      more days ill and are separated from doing what they love.


      Avery Telehealth is here to change that. We offer a patient engagement
      solution that reduces hospital readmissions guaranteed. Hospital systems
      see improved patient outcomes, and all parties involved realize lower
      healthcare costs.
