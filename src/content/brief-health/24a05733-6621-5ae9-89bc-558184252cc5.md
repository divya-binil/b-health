In recent times, Apple has been making a number of public moves focused on getting its customers to pull their health data onto their iPhone. Using Apple’s Health app, consumers can have their health data downloaded automatically from any institution with which it has partnered.

Now, a new non-profit industry group has come together to create an open-source version of the Apple toolset which can be used by Android device users. The initiative is being launched by Cornell Tech, UC San Francisco, Sage Bionetworks, Open mHealth and The Commons Project. According to the group’s announcement, CommonHealth will incorporate HL7 FHIR and other interoperability standards to offer Android users functionality similar to the Apple Health app.

CommonHealth is being piloted at UC San Francisco and a handful of other academic medical centers and health systems. Now that it’s past the pilot stage. the group is inviting other academic medical centers, health systems or developers to get involved.
