<p>I think most of us agree that telehealth is here to stay.&nbsp; To what degree is something that will be discussed for a while to come.&nbsp; No doubt telehealth won’t remain at the inflated levels that COVID-19 and shutdowns required, but it will plateau at some reasonable level and then likely grow over time as we discover what other things we can safely do through telehealth.</p><p>Healthcare IT Today recently sat down with&nbsp;Dr. Mia Finkelston, Senior Medical Director at <a href="https://business.amwell.com/">Amwell</a>, to talk about her experience as a physician doing telehealth prior to COVID-19, during the initial days of COVID-19, and now as we get into more of a rhythm living with COVID-19.&nbsp; She offered a number of unique physician perspectives on the types of patients she was seeing on telehealth during each time period.</p><p>We also asked Dr. Mia where she thinks telehealth adoption will land as we settle into COVID and what she thinks will set Amwell apart in the telehealth market.&nbsp; Plus, we asked her about what an “enterprise” telehealth system would need to include and what she thinks about Amwell being a competitor to many of their customers.&nbsp; Finally, we talked about telehealth reimbursement and where it’s heading along with asking her what people don’t understand about telehealth that they should.</p><p>If you want to learn about telehealth from a doctor who’s literally on the front lines seeing telehealth patients, you’ll enjoy this interview with Dr. Mia.</p>
