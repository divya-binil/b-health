<p>But inadequacies in current payer/provider communication often disrupt the flow of timely care and lead to unnecessary hospital readmissions and poor outcomes.
With real-time admission, discharge, and transfer (ADT) notifications, payers can help steer members to better care options while reducing costs through such actions as eliminating redundant tests before the expense occurs.
Automatic electronic ADT notifications recast payers and providers as natural allies to improve care outcomes and reduce spending.
This can mean lining up an in-network acute care facility or ensuring the member complies with a follow-up appointment with a primary care physician or specialist post-hospital discharge since payers have already negotiated favorable rates with in-network providers.
When the payer can offer care management to members and direct them to the most appropriate providers, this leads to better health outcomes, a reduction in redundant care, and an improved experience for the member.
However, real-time ADT notifications that provide input on each step of a member’s care journey can improve visibility into that journey to boost both care outcomes and the payer’s bottom line.
Electronic real-time ADT notifications connect providers and care teams wherever patients receive care.
Payers can coordinate and eliminate gaps in care while managing member health at the point of care; and patients can receive faster treatment based on real-time data, which results in improved health outcomes.</p>
