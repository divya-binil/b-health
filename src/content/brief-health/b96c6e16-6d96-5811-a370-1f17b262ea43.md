<p>Japan has only made telepharmacy available in September.<br><br>Although telepharmacy has been found useful in Japan's rural areas, the active involvement of pharmacists in these communities will help boost its effectiveness.
A recently published study in the journal Drug Discoveries &amp; Therapeutics explored patients' perspectives on telepharmacy in a mountain region in the country.
It was only in September that the Japanese government made available telepharmacy, five years since telemedicine was permitted in rural areas across the country.</p>
