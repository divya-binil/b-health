<p>Six innovative new solutions are being unveiled by Innovaccer to assist providers in achieving greater success in the areas of population health, consumerism, and value-based care. Sara, the first conversational AI for healthcare analytics, is at the head of the pack. Healthcare management, doctors, and care teams now have access to the full breadth and depth of business healthcare analytics thanks to Sara, a conversational AI assistant. Anyone can ask Sara challenging questions about the patient population in your health system and receive prompt responses on clinical, monetary, or operational parameters. The first enterprise customer relationship management (CRM) solution created specifically for the healthcare industry is Innovaccer's Health 1:1. A longitudinal consumer/patient record that incorporates all of a patient's clinical and consumer data allows health systems to find new patients, direct existing patients.</p>
