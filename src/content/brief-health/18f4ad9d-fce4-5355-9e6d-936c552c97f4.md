<p>– Today, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/">Mayo Clinic</a> and <a href="http://verily.com/">Verily</a>, an Alphabet company announced a strategic two-year collaboration to develop clinical decision support solutions. This modular, evidence-based decision support solution, will provide contextualized and validated knowledge on disease management, care guidelines, and treatment to help clinicians make decisions.</p><p>– The clinical decision support tool will be developed based on a broad range of health-relevant data sources, including Mayo-vetted clinical knowledge and de-identified <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/category/emr-ehr/">EHR</a> data. The tool will use open standards to enable integration with multiple commercial electronic health records. As part of the strategic partnership, the solution will be rolled out at Mayo Clinic with the opportunity to extend the new solution to Verily’s health system partners and customers.</p>
