<p>There's lots of work to do expanding access for underserved patients, said experts at the American Telemedicine Association's EDGE policy conference.<br><br>The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a flurry of changes to regulations around telehealth and virtual care â€“ the vast majority of which expire once the public health emergency ends.</p><p>The current <a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/cms-begins-implementing-permanent-telehealth-changes-under-trump-executive-order">presidential administration</a>&nbsp;and 116th Congress have each <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/ata-applauds-reforms-stark-law-anti-kickback-statute">signaled their support</a> for virtual care to various degrees over the past year. But neither took decisive, sweeping action that would permanently enshrine some of the major changes to telehealth policy.</p><p>So, the question on the minds of many telehealth advocates as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office is: What's next?</p><p>"We are at an inflection point, and inflections bring new challenges," said former senate majority leader Dr. William Frist, R-Tennessee, during the first day of the American Telemedicine Association's four-part EDGE policy conference on Tuesday.</p><p>"Inflections demand changed perspectives, changed understanding, changed behaviors on our parts," said Frist, a surgeon who is now a director at Teladoc and partner at Frist Cressey Ventures.</p>
