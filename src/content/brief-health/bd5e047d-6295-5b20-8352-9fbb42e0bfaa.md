<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As T2D (type 2 diabetes) and liver disease rates rise, increased risks of cirrhosis, liver cancers, and other ailments loom. But to combat such severe health threats, digital health innovation can be a game-changer. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By embracing emerging trends in healthcare tech, we can mitigate these chronic illnesses&#8217; risks and help countless people with T2D manage their conditions. Let&#8217;s dive deep into how this unique, cutting-edge approach can improve patient outcomes and prevent liver diseases.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Type 2 Diabetes and NAFLD</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/type2.html#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20type%202,prediabetes%20and%20type%202%20diabetes." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Type 2 diabetes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a type of health condition that indicates an irregularity in how the body handles glucose metabolism (sugar). With this health condition, the body risks getting liver diseases. Some of the liver conditions type 2 diabetes patients can be exposed to are:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Severe liver scarring</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liver cancer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liver failure</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of all the liver conditions mentioned above, type 2 diabetes patients are more at risk of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to common misconception, NAFLD in diabetic patients is not caused by alcohol consumption. According to the </span><a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2018/uf-health-researchers-study-association-between-type-2-diabetes-and-fatty-liver-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Florida Health Newsroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, scientists believe a metabolic breakdown in the body, such as that seen in type 2 diabetes, results in the release of fatty acids into the blood, ultimately accumulating in a ready receptacle — the liver. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diabetes patients must look out for NAFLD because although it shows no symptoms, it can increase the risk of other health problems like cirrhosis or, even more severe, liver cancer. </span><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/liver-health-tips#What-is-NAFLD?" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attests that it&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> possible to develop NAFLD with type 2 diabetes, even if you rarely drink alcohol.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Digital Health Strategies Adopted by Care Providers to Mitigate the Risk of Liver Disease in Type 2 Diabetes</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As healthcare providers continue to navigate the complex landscape of managing Type 2 Diabetes, the risk of liver disease looms large as a potential complication. In order to mitigate this risk, digital health strategies have been increasingly adopted by care providers. These strategies encompass a range of technologies such as mobile applications and wearable devices, among others. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These technologies allow patients to monitor their blood glucose levels, manage medications, and track their daily activity. In addition, care providers can monitor their patients’ progress, learn about their risk factors, and provide timely guidance to prevent the occurrence of liver disease. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these digital health strategies, care providers can tailor their care to their patients’ needs, allowing for more proactive and personalized care. As the prevalence of T2DM continues to rise, the use of digital health strategies has become an essential tool for care providers to help prevent the onset of liver disease in their patients. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Digital Technologies and Early Liver Disease Detection: How It’s Done?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liver disease might not show early symptoms. Sometimes, it is not discovered until a </span><a href="https://www.fibronostics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">liver blood test</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is carried out. This test, known as the liver function test, is used to help diagnose and monitor liver disease or damage. NAFLD mostly shows no symptoms, so doctors need to run tests to determine its presence. To make early diagnosis easier, however, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">care providers use certain technological advancements which integrate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AI technologies. </span><a href="https://www.hospimedica.com/artificial-intelligence/articles/294796671/ai-helps-identify-liver-cirrhosis-using-electronic-health-records.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI integration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is now being used to process huge chunks of data for more accurate results. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transformation of disease detection due to digitalization and pioneering technologies has resulted in improved prognoses for patients. This new era in liver screening, for example, is being powered by digital algorithms that determine the likelihood of patients needing further testing for early-stage diagnosis. Although current ultrasound examinations have a sensitivity of only 45%, combining them with protein-level blood tests can increase the detection of early-stage liver disease, such as liver cancer, by 18%. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, by combining additional blood tests with age and gender in an algorithm, physicians can determine if their patient requires further testing for diagnosis. This highlights the promise of digital diagnostics in not only improving patient outcomes but also potentially reducing healthcare system burdens. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tip to Reduce The Risk Of Liver Disease With Type 2 Diabetes</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While regular monitoring is necessary to help lower the risk of potential complications from type 2 diabetes, there are several steps you can take to reduce your risk of getting a liver condition linked to it.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are some of the ways to reduce that risk:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Watch Your Weight. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Losing weight is medically considered the best strategy for </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4389/2/4/22" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reducing the risks of NAFLD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If diets and workouts are ineffective, consult your doctors on the possibility of using weight-loss medications or even having weight-loss surgery.</span></li>
<li><b>Monitor Your Sugar Level. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should work closely with your doctor to manage your blood sugar well. This is one way to prevent  NAFLD. Alongside monitoring your sugar level, you should also monitor your blood pressure. To keep your blood pressure within a safe range, you can reduce the consumption of sodium and caffeinated foods and reduce or stop smoking.</span></li>
<li><b>Consume A Balanced Diet. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To manage diabetes and reduce your risks of liver disease, your doctor might recommend changing your diet. You will be discouraged from consuming certain kinds of food including fatty, salty, and sugary meals. </span></li>
<li><b>Exercise Regularly. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular exercise is another lifestyle type 2 diabetic patients must adopt. Based on your doctor’s recommendations, exercise as many times as possible. </span></li>
<li><b>Reduce Or Stop Alcohol Consumption. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excessive consumption of alcohol is equal to welcoming liver disease. You should consult your primary care provider on what limit is best for you. </span></li>
