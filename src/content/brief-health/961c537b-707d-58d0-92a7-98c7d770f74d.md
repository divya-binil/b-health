<p>Today, it’s more important than ever to engage physicians during early innovation development and marketing planning to understand the voice of the patient.
Physicians see patients and prescribe treatments day in and day out, allowing for a deeper understanding of both new health products and their end-users.
As a close and trusted touchpoint with patients, physicians’ in-depth discussions allow them to hear firsthand their patient’s personal perspectives, needs and desires for healthcare, helping inform their approach to healthcare – whether that’s prescribing a particular medication over another, or using a particular device.
As such, physicians are positioned to be a powerful resource with exclusive insights for pharmaceutical teams to optimize new product development or the presentation of drug-related information to consumers based on their collaboration with patients.
</p><p>Being deeply ingrained within the industry, physicians can elevate a new development team’s marketing strategy and ensure medical accuracy.
By engaging with a new drug, prescription, or OTC medication, physicians can help companies in the pharmaceutical sector with research, development and marketing to ensure the best treatment for patients with minimal side effects, and maximum effectiveness.
Bringing real-world data and observations, as well as a critical thinking approach, this collaboration is a win-win: other organizations and industries improve their own concepts and development; patients benefit from physician-consulted products and innovations; and physicians can break up their traditional day-to-day work with non-clinical opportunities, further stimulating and expanding their minds to bring new, fresh ideas to their clinical practice.</p>
