<p>Revenue cycle processes are often highly repetitive yet still manually performed, making them ideal for automation.
During an October webinar hosted by Becker's Hospital Review and sponsored by Xtend Healthcare, Mike Morris, president and CEO, and Billy Padilla, CIO, discussed why health systems should automate the revenue cycle, steps they can take to get started and the benefits they can expect to see.
1. Limited resources, manual tasks, a labor shortage and lack of standardization in the revenue cycle can be improved with automation.
"There are still too many manual and repetitive tasks that take place every day, and healthcare providers have trouble attracting and retaining qualified staff.” Moreover, a lack of standard processes for people who work in a disparate and geographically distributed environment is another impediment that can be removed with the help of stronger automation, Mr. Morris said.
"You don't want to automate a previously manual function based on imprecise or imperfect data," Mr. Morris added.</p>
