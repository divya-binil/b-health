<p>According to the organizations, UC Davis Health and AWS will each commit staff to explore digital health equity issues through the CIC alongside clinicians, students, groups and the community.
"We are committed to advancing digital-first and data-driven models of care to continue to provide exceptional patient care and experiences," said Keisuke Nakagawa, executive director of the UC Davis Health CIC and director of innovation for the Digital CoLab.
UC Davis Health says it is the first academic medical center to launch a CIC of this kind with AWS, but Amazon's focus on cloud-driven health technology is not new.
"Our collaboration with UC Davis Health, a vast and diverse health system, brings together our commitment to improve health outcomes with an organization that is deeply invested in addressing health disparities and providing the best care to communities," said Kim Majerus, vice president of education, state and local government at AWS.</p>
