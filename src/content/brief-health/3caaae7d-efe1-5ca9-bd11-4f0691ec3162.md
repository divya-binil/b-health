<p>Scientific studies show that the quality of patient education has a significant impact on patient health outcomes and the need for postoperative care. Furthermore, audio-visual patient education improves patient understanding, patient satisfaction, and overall adherence and compliance towards the medical treatment process.
Conversely, doctors must invest their valuable time in bridging the information gap starting with the basics during patient consultation and repeating information over and over again.
Our solution enables doctors to create individualized patient videos within seconds while ensuring that the content is legally compliant and tailored to patients’ needs.
This approach saves time for doctors in the educational process and overall, gives patients a better feeling of empowerment.
Being able to bridge this information gap in patient education and empowering patients so they are not feeling stressed or anxious about their medical procedure, helps them to be more optimistic about the overall treatment process.</p><p>This gives patients the opportunity to take the information home and share it with family and friends, and discuss the procedure that they’re going to have, enabling them to take a more active part in their treatment process.
Mona Ciotta: &nbsp;As per current legal requirements, the status quo with the paper sheets is not entirely compliant because patients are not empowered to make an informed decision.
Secondly, by standardizing the process of informed consent using a solution that gives patients the same quality of information based on their specific needs.
The medical information that patients are given during their treatment process lacks patient-focused language and visuals.
Doctors just cross out information that is not relevant to the patient, which is not ideal.
We see a tremendous need and desire for patients to receive personalized information and specifically validated information.
When doctors can create videos tailored to patients’ needs, one can be sure that the content patients receive is validated, medically sound, and fit for patient purposes.
While it has its downsides of having access to all kinds of information, democratizing it has been a huge step toward empowering patients and enabling them to make better decisions regarding their treatment process.
This transformation is about eliminating the barriers of this medical paternalism age and enabling patients to make informed decisions by giving them the information they need and want.</p>
