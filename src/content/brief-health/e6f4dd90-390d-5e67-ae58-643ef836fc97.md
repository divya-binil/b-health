<p>At a HIMSS21 Views from the Top session, experts explained how to maximize the value of available information by optimizing data supply chains.<br><br>Whether it's from telemedicine, wearables and or electronic health records, a growing amount of healthcare data&nbsp;is becoming available on both an individual and population-wide level.&nbsp;</p><p>"But just because you have data," pointed out Michael Meucci, chief operating officer at Arcadia, "doesn't mean that it's meaningful." &nbsp;</p><p>In a HIMSS21 session here on Thursday, Meucci and his co-panelists explained how an optimized data supply chain can save stakeholders time and resources – and allow them to maximize the value of information as an asset. &nbsp;</p><p>As Meucci explained, traditional, supply-chain driven data projects usually involve building new pipelines for each need.</p><p>"It takes 12, 15, 24 weeks at times," he said. "And at the end of the day, the end product may not actually be what you wanted&nbsp;because you were constrained by the data … coming through that data pipe."</p><p>Alternatively, an optimized data supply chain involves pulling the entire source into a schema-less lake, thus increasing its liquidity.&nbsp;</p>
