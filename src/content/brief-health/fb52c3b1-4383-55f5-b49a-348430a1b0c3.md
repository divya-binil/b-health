<p>Synapse Medicine clinical decision support technology analyzes drug-related risks based on each patient's clinical characteristics and will be studied for its impact on inpatient pharmacist efficacy and efficiency. Synapse Medicine, a leader in intelligent medication decision technology, announced today it has initiated a clinical study with Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA and the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN to measure the benefits and efficacy of its clinical decision support solution and its medication reconciliation software in a hospital setting.
Participants will use Synapse Medicine point-of-care tools to analyze drug-related risks and optimize medication appropriateness.
"Optimizing a patient's medication regimen can be a time-consuming and complicated process, but it is fundamental to ensuring patient safety and therapeutic success," shared Dr. Clement Goehrs, Synapse Medicine CEO and Co-Founder.
It combines real-time drug knowledge with clinical data to detect potential medication risks and discrepancies that can lead to ADEs. The suite of clinical decision support tools enables healthcare professionals to provide enhanced personalized care for patients.</p>
