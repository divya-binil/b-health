ARMONK, N.Y., Feb. 13, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM Watson Health (NYSE: IBM) today announced plans to make a 10-year, $50 million investment in research collaborations with two separate academic centers - Brigham and Women's Hospital, which is a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, and Vanderbilt University Medical Center - to advance the science of artificial intelligence (AI) and its application to major public health issues.

The scientific collaborations with each institution will focus on critical health problems that are ideally suited for AI solutions. Initial areas of study are expected to include the use of AI to improve the utility of electronic health records (EHRs)[1] and claims data[2] to address significant public health issues like patient safety[3], precision medicine[4] and health equity[5]. The research will also explore physician and patient user experience and interactions with AI technologies.
