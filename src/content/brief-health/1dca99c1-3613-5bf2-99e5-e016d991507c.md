<p>We are all born with a genetic code that essentially does not change over time. Contained within, is a wealth of data pertaining to the health of an individual; such as in the diagnosis or predictive risk of developing a certain condition, or in assessing their ability to respond to certain treatments and dosages.&nbsp;</p><p>It is unavoidable and perhaps a hard truth that, as humans, we all have mutations or specific sections of DNA that encode for something that will negatively impact our health at one stage in our life. As we grow and our body is exposed to different risk factors that can exacerbate those already present in our DNA, a decline in health is inevitable.&nbsp;</p><p>For some, this is attributed to a lifestyle choice, such as smoking, alcohol, or a lack of exercise. For others, it can be the simple intake of a particular amino acid that causes detrimental effects, such as in patients diagnosed with phenylketonuria – an inherited metabolic disease that increases the levels of phenylalanine in the blood. If left untreated, this disease can lead to mental disability and serious health outcomes. However, simply controlling phenylalanine intake from the early weeks of life can allow patients to lead a normal life.&nbsp;</p>
