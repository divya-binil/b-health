<p>Digital health funding amounted to $15.3B across 572 deals, with an average deal size of $27M, according to Rock Health's 2022 annual report. According to Rock Health's Annual 2022 Digital Health Funding Report, things don't have to be bleak in a down market environment. The year 2022 served as a crucial reminder that investments are cyclical and that resilient players can withstand shifts in the funding environment. Analysts predict that healthcare startups and established companies will both rely on slow, steady, and possibly boring techniques to succeed in 2023. These strategies include managing finances, reorganising to account for revenue unpredictability, and investing in technology infrastructure. Many people will recall the year 2022 as it comes to an end as being notorious for inflation, stock market declines, and seven interest rate hikes that appeared to be developing into a potential recession.</p>
