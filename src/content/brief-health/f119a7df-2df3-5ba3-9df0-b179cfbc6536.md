<p>Review the Panel’s recommended strategies for managing patients with COVID-19 based on disease severity.<br><br>Two main processes are thought to drive the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Early in the course of the infection, the disease is primarily driven by replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Later in the course of infection, the disease is driven by an exaggerated immune/inflammatory response to the virus that leads to tissue damage. Based on this understanding, it is anticipated that antiviral therapies would have the greatest effect early in the course of disease, while immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory therapies are likely to be more beneficial in the later stages of COVID-19.</p><p>In the earliest stages of infection, before the host has mounted an effective immune response, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based therapies may have their greatest likelihood of having an effect. In this regard, although there are insufficient data from clinical trials to recommend either for or against the use of any specific therapy in this setting, preliminary data suggests that outpatients may benefit from receiving anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies early in the course of infection. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies <a href="https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/statement-on-bamlanivimab-eua/">bamlanivimab</a> and <a href="https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/statement-on-casirivimab-plus-imdevimab-eua/">casirivimab plus imdevimab</a> are available through Emergency Use Authorizations for outpatients who are at high risk for disease progression.</p>
