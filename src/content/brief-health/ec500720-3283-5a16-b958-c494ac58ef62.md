<p>There's a growing commitment to leverage the potential of healthcare technologies for better patient outcomes and more equitable access to care. The World Health Organization estimates that by the end of 2021, key healthcare services were 44% disrupted in all countries. This is hardly surprising considering how healthcare systems around the world have had to adjust to extraordinary disruptions and increasing demands brought on by a pandemic. This sobering fact highlighted the necessity for these systems to be able to handle the demands of an ageing and increasing population as well as a challenging operating environment marked by unequal access to high-quality care. While global transformations and reforms have begun to take shape at varied rates, there has also been a rising determination to use healthcare technologies to their fullest capacity to improve patient outcomes and promote more equitable access to care.</p>
