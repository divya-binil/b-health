<p>Healthcare looks quite different than it did just a few short years ago. The COVID-19 crisis has created a distinct “before” and “after” for the world, and especially for healthcare. The pandemic forced the entire industry to quickly adopt and advance their health IT, creating new urgency and interest in telemedicine, <a href="https://oliveai.com/blog/the-importance-of-healthcare-data-security/">data security</a> and more. We are seeing more innovation than ever before, which is spurring investment in new technological developments.&nbsp;</p><p>Given how much change has happened in the past 12-18 months, we set out to understand what’s top of mind for healthcare industry leaders <i>now</i> and what they’re keeping tabs on throughout the rest of the year. Here are the four key trends that emerged, and that you can expect to hear about at <a href="https://discover.oliveai.com/HIMSS-2021.html">HIMSS21</a>:</p><h2><strong>1. Emergence of healthcare ecosystems and platforms</strong></h2><p>We know that to truly transform healthcare and create equal access to the most innovative and cutting-edge technologies, healthcare needs a <a href="https://www.sllane.com/log/platforms-partnerships-and-penumbras">ubiquitous platform</a> that is open to all developers and all organizations. We’re working on this vision now. Our software is ready, and now we’re sharing the technology and the dream with the entire industry.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-thrailkill-95a39110/">Eric Thrailkill</a>, Founder of Allee Advisory Services LLC, noted that ecosystems, platforms, marketplaces and partnerships are critical to driving true change in the industry as we move forward. He said he’s “…optimistic we’ll take pandemic learning and create next generation, patient-centered solutions, to a new level. The industry demonstrated near-impossible achievement, yet laid bare existing issues of cost, access, quality and equity. An ‘ecosystem mindset’ is essential to truly accelerate the journey to value.”</p>
