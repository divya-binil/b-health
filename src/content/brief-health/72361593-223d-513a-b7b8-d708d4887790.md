    Dozens of frameworks have been proposed to assess evidence for digital
    health interventions (DHIs), but existing frameworks may not facilitate DHI
    evidence reviews that meet the needs of stakeholder organizations including
    payers, health systems, trade organizations, and others. These organizations
    may benefit from a DHI assessment framework that is both rigorous and rapid.
    Here we propose a framework to assess Evidence in Digital health for
    EFfectiveness of INterventions with Evaluative Depth (Evidence DEFINED).
    Designed for real-world use, the Evidence DEFINED Quick Start Guide may help
    streamline DHI assessment. A checklist is provided summarizing high-priority
    evidence considerations in digital health. Evidence-to-recommendation
    guidelines are proposed, specifying degrees of adoption that may be
    appropriate for a range of evidence quality levels. Evidence DEFINED differs
    from prior frameworks in its inclusion of unique elements designed for rigor
    and speed. Rigor is increased by addressing three gaps in prior frameworks.
    First, prior frameworks are not adapted adequately to address evidence
    considerations that are unique to digital health. Second, prior frameworks
    do not specify evidence quality criteria requiring increased vigilance for
    DHIs in the current regulatory context. Third, extant frameworks rarely
    leverage established, robust methodologies that were developed for
    non-digital interventions. Speed is achieved in the Evidence DEFINED
    Framework through screening optimization and deprioritization of steps that
    may have limited value. The primary goals of Evidence DEFINED are to a)
    facilitate standardized, rapid, rigorous DHI evidence assessment in
    organizations and b) guide digital health solutions providers who wish to
    generate evidence that drives DHI adoption.
