<p>Some healthcare provider organizations are using machine learning and other forms of artificial intelligence to provide clinicians with the best evidence-based care pathways.</p><p>A group's&nbsp;aim could&nbsp;be to improve a patient's care plan based on personalized analytics. Another goal could&nbsp;be the further merging of&nbsp;evidence-based care paths with historical utilization and outcomes in order to offer optimal patient care. Provider organizations might be using social determinants of health&nbsp;combined with machine learning to offer clinically meaningful services.</p><p><i>Healthcare IT News</i> talked over these ideas with Niall O'Connor, chief technology officer at Cohere Health, a vendor of artificial intelligence technology and services designed to improve the provider, patient and payer experiences.</p><p><strong>Q: How is machine learning being used to comprehensively enhance a patient's entire care plan based on personalized analytics? And how is machine learning being used to combine evidence-based care paths – with real-world historical utilization, outcomes and the latest literature – to provide first-rate patient care?</strong></p>
