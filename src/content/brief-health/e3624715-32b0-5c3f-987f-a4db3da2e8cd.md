<p>To make their content eligible for health source information panels, licenced healthcare providers can submit an application. Prior until this, only entities including educational institutions, hospitals, and public health departments could use the features. YouTube is extending its product capabilities to include videos created by qualified healthcare professionals as part of its mission to give information and context about reliable health sources. The health source information panels, which were initially made available in the United States last year, identify health material from reliable sources such government agencies, hospitals, public health departments, and educational institutions. These films are retrieved from shelves of health-related content that appear at the top of health-related searches. Healthcare practitioners can now seek to have their content included in this category.&nbsp;</p>
