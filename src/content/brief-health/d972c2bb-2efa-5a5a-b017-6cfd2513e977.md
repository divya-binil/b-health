<p>Cue Health, a provider of at-home diagnostics, announced in an SEC filing that it is letting go of 388 workers, or roughly 26% of its personnel, in order to adapt to the economy's shifting conditions. The Jan. 5 filing notes that the termination dates are anticipated to occur in March. 170 people were let go by the corporation in June as a result of reductions in government funding for COVID testing. A company representative wrote Becker's, saying, "Given our tremendous expansion over the last three years and the current adverse financial environment, the Cue Health leadership team has been considering how best to position the company for the future." We are still optimistic in our long-term plan to enhance the way healthcare is provided, which will ultimately result in better outcomes for people's health.</p>
