<p>The University of Notre Dame and Accenture recently announced a partnership for a health equity data lab that will use artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve healthcare for vulnerable populations. The University of Notre Dame, which is based in South Bend, Indiana, stated in a news release on January 4 that it will collaborate with Accenture, which has its headquarters in Palo Alto, California, to establish a health equity data lab. According to the news release, the University of Notre Dame's Lucy Family Institute for Data and Society is working with partners on campus and in the community to create a more comprehensive strategy for tackling these issues through its new Health Equity Data Lab. Nitesh Chawla, the institute's founding director and the Frank M. Freimann Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, is leading the Accenture Health Equity Data project, the lab's inaugural project funded by a gift from Accenture. Additionally, Accenture has committed to a fundraising effort with its staff and alumni.</p>
