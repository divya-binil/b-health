<p>The meeting of the Emergency Committee (EC) convened on 14 January under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/15-01-2021-statement-on-the-sixth-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-pandemic">agreed</a> that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The disease was <a href="https://healthmanagement.org/s/who-declares-public-health-emergency">declared</a> a PHEIC last January, and the EC took place for the sixth time since the start of the pandemic headed the WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.&nbsp;</p><p>The EC members reviewed the new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and assessed the implications of vaccination and testing programmes for various fields including international travel.</p><p>WHO recognised the global risk level as very high due, in part, to recent reports of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. With this regard, genomic sequencing and sharing of data on emerging variants should be available globally, the experts stressed highlighting the need to create a standardised system for naming the new variants.</p>
