<p>With $20 million from Flare Capital Partners, Inbound Health will assist providers and health plans in creating models for skilled nursing and home-based acute care. Inbound Health, a new business founded by Minneapolis-based Allina Health in partnership with Flare Capital Partners, is intended to assist health systems and payers in the design and development of hospital-at-home and home-based skilled nursing services. According to Allina Health, the objective of Inbound Health is to provide the full set of capabilities required to scale at-home care models, including workflow and engagement technologies, analytics, virtual care teams, home-based care pathways, supply chain alliances, operational oversight, and payment models. Dave Kerwar, the CEO of the new business, previously held the position of chief product officer at Mount Sinai Health System.</p>
