<p>Every two minutes, a leg is amputated in the United States alone. An innovative digital project called SL2 for "Saving Limbs. Saving Lives" is tackling this sobering figure, as it was revealed at the New Cardiovascular Horizons (NCVH) Annual Conference. All members of the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA), the biggest non-profit organization in the US devoted to advancing the practice of foot and ankle medicine, are now eligible to enroll in SL.</p><p>Members of APMA will have access to CarePICS, a piece of software designed to promote best practices in wound care. This programme includes electronic consults and electronic referrals for the best possible interaction with other professionals in the vascular community. The fact that many of the activities supported by CarePICS are eligible for reimbursement is an added bonus.&nbsp;</p>
