<p>Sometimes things are more than what they seem. | Teleneurology is often seen as just stroke care, but for those impacted by other neurological conditions, patients, families, and healthcare providers can rely on teleneurology’s many advantages.<br><br>It is a fact that stroke patients need to be seen quickly, and teleneurology can certainly deliver that care;however, neurological patients who aren’t in need of immediate care still need to be seen in an appropriate time frame.
The reality for many neurological patients is that they can spend an average of 32 days waiting for an appointment with a neurologist.
Better Care for All Patients
This added responsibility often leads to burnout (which, according to recent studies,already impacts nearly 60% of neurologists), lessens the quality of care, and reduces the continuity of care that neurology patients rely on.
However,because some hospitals simply have limited onsite neurologists to allocate enough staff towards this level of care, many patients leave the facility with no follow-up strategy.
By providing access to virtual neurologists, millions of patients and their families can receive much needed care for neurological conditions that extend beyond just strokes.
With reduced wait times, better care for all patients, and increased patient satisfaction and outcomes, the opportunities for teleneurology represent more than what they may seem.</p>
