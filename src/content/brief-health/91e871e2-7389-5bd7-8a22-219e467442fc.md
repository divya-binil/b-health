“Refugees are persons who are outside their country of origin for reasons of feared persecution, conflict, generalized violence, or other circumstances which have seriously disturbed public order and, as a result, require international protection,” writes the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). However, refugees’ plea isn’t limited to people leaving their home country en masse following atrocious wars or political instability, but can be that of anyone else, like you and me, following unforeseen calamities, be it natural or man-made, leading to similar situations.
