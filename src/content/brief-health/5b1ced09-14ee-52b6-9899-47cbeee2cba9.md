<p>Using the data on lung cancer from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry, a team of researchers at PennState assessed the survival period predictions by three DL architectures – Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) – as well as compared the DL models’ performance against traditional machine learning models. Both cancer survival classification and regression approaches were implemented.</p><p>The findings show that under certain conditions DL models’ accuracy was 71.18% while the traditional machine learning models predicted the survival periods with an accuracy rate of 61.12%.&nbsp;</p><p>The researchers also conducted feature importance analysis to investigate the model interpretability, i.e. to evaluate how a combination of relevant factors, such as types of cancer, size of tumours, or the speed of tumour growth, impact lung cancer survival periods.</p>
