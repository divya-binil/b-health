<p>The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT is soliciting public feedback about longer-term health interoperability outcomes.<br><br>The U.S. Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT announced the launch of its Health Interoperability Outcomes 2030 effort, aimed at building on current interoperability efforts and working toward longer-term strategies. &nbsp;</p><p>"Throughout my tenure at ONC, different policy, technology, and legislative moments along with ample public feedback have shaped our actions," wrote Deputy National Coordinator Steve Posnack in a blog post accompanying the announcement.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>"Yet, there always comes a time to ask, 'Whatâ€™s next? What are we driving toward? How do we turn actions into outcomes?' Now's that time," Posnack continued. &nbsp;</p>
