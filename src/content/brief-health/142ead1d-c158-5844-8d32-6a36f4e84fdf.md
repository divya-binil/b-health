<p>The deal will allow the company to offer a combination of in-person physical therapy and virtual coaching tools. Workers compensation-focused Bardavon Health Innovations has acquired digital musculoskeletal care startup PeerWell in a cash and stock deal for an undisclosed amount.
Bardavon, which offers tools for injury prevention, treatment planning, and case-tracking and documentation, will use PeerWell to offer both in-person physical therapy and virtual coaching. The company said the digital MSK platform will complement its bNotes clinical guidance tool, which connects employers and therapy providers to track outcomes.</p>
