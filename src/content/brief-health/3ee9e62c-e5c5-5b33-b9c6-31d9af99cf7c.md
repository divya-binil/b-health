<p>Baby tech company Owlet announced a new smart baby monitor dubbed the Owlet Dream Duo, which was designed to help track a baby’s sleep and provide insights about the child’s sleep needs.
Users can tap into the Dream App, which includes information about a baby’s sleep status, sleep quality score, sleep trends and sleep quality indicators.
The Dream Duo's prompts are based on sleep quality indicators,” Owlet wrote on its information page.
“A survey found that parents can lose an average of 44 nights of sleep in the first year alone, but with the Dream Duo’s sleep learning program for babies 4 to 12 months, 90% of parents report improved sleep for their baby in just one week.
"The new Dream Duo aims to help babies – and their parents – sleep better.</p>
