Mr. Goswami will serve on the panel &quot;What Top Hospital IT Team Will Look Like in 2030&quot; at Becker&#39;s 7th Annual Health IT + Digital Health + RCM Annual Meeting: The Future of Business and Clinical Technologies. Chero Goswami: For starters, information systems in a healthcare organization primarily exist to provide: patient experience and satisfaction, provider and workforce efficiency, quality and safety, fiscal stewardship and enabling research and innovation. Whether adopting virtual care services, remote patient monitoring by patients and providers, using machine learning and AI for developing new algorithms for complex care models, or using automation to help manage some of the challenges with workforce shortages â€” every venue is an opportunity. In the same vein, providing care to our patients in our community by meeting them where they are, is a significant opportunity. Be that for behavioral health patients, adolescents/teenagers or those taking care of elderly parents for every scenario providing care when and where needed is becoming an expectation. Technology helps bridge the time and distance gap, reducing anxiety for the patient or family and avoiding unnecessary hospital visits, thus reducing the providers&#39; workload. The CIO and IT teams need to provide an outside-in view of the traditional healthcare mindset.
