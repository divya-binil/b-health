    description: >-
      We set out to completely redesign the arrhythmia monitor to elevate signal
      detection, comfort, and ease of use. Using feedback from patients,
      clinicians and physicians, we addressed the long-standing complaint in
      cardiac arrhythmia monitoring that traditional monitors are bulky,
      uncomfortable and typically record noisy QRS signals. After years of
      meticulous R&D, Bardy Diagnostics developed the first continuous-wear,
      wire-free ambulatory patch monitor that provides unparalleled signal
      clarity with a focus on the P-wave. To this day, we continue to deliver
      technology solutions that advance the field of cardiac monitoring.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> 		<p><strong>BELLEVUE, WA </strong>— July 29, 2021– A recent clinical study from Overlake Medical Center utilizing the Bardy Diagnostics Carnation Ambulatory Monitor (CAM) patch was presented at the 2021 Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) Conference. <a href="https://cattendee.abstractsonline.com/meeting/9255/Presentation/4770">The abstract</a>, “Accelerating Proper Evaluation of Emergency Department Patients for Arrhythmia Concerns with Discharge Use of ECG Patch Monitors,” authored by Marie Yabut, Sarahi Gomes-Duarte, MA., and Eric Shipley, MD, MBA., explores the role of the CAM ECG monitor as a solution for outpatient evaluation after presenting symptoms of cardiac arrhythmias with an inconclusive diagnosis in the emergency department. The decision to either admit or discharge patients for outpatient evaluation is typically arbitrary and there are few alternatives. The abstract concludes that emergency department adoption of ECG monitoring provided an alternative to hospital admission while providing a diagnosis 3 times sooner than average and dramatically reducing return visits to the emergency department.</p> <p>By utilizing the CAM patch on 412 patients over the 2-year period, the average time of emergency department discharge to diagnosis was 7 days compared to the previous average of 21 days. In addition, emergency department readmissions within 30 days of the initial visit decreased to 7% of study patients compared to readmission of 40% of patients who had the same type of cardiac complaints in the year prior to CAM patch availability.</p> <p>According to Yabut, using the CAM patch in the emergency department was crucial in providing care for patients with cardiac arrhythmia symptoms occurring outside of normal clinic operating hours. “In the process of this study, we discovered that most patients discharged with the patch occurred outside clinic hours. The availability of the patch in the emergency department benefitted patients who would have otherwise been discharged without a cardiac monitor.” Without application of the CAM patch in the emergency department, patients may experience a substantial waiting period until receiving diagnostic results and proper care.</p> <p>The study also revealed that using the CAM patch as a point of care solution in the emergency department resulted in new patient referrals to the cardiology/EP department. Between 2018 and 2020, 369 patients were discharged with the CAM patch from the emergency department, and 57 of those patients were then established as cardiac patients. Additionally, 209 patients in the study had no prior cardiology care and were new referrals to Overlake Medical Center’s cardiology/EP department. Due to the diagnostic capabilities of the CAM patch, 178 patients either received further diagnostic testing or a cardiac procedure.</p> <p>Bardy Diagnostics will be showcasing their CAM patch technology at the 2021 Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) conference in Boston and participating in the conference both virtually and in-person with an exhibitor booth offering visitors an opportunity to explore clinical case studies, experience a new interactive arrhythmia challenge, view a product demo, and discuss clinical issues and trends with the founder of Bardy Diagnostics, Gust H. Bardy, MD. Visit booth #760 at HRS or go to <a href="http://www.bardydx.com/hrs2021">www.bardydx.com/hrs2021</a>.</p>   <p>Source:</p> <p>Yabut, M., Gomez-Duarte, S. &amp; Shipley, E. (2021, February 11). Accelerating Proper Evaluation Of Emergency Department Patients For Arrhythmia Concerns With Discharge Use Of ECG Patch Monitors. Overlake Medical Center, Bellevue, WA; cOASIS, The Online Abstract Submission and Invitation System.</p> <p><strong>About Bardy Diagnostics</strong></p> <p>Bardy Diagnostics, Inc. is an innovator in digital health and remote patient monitoring, with a focus on providing the most diagnostically accurate and patient-friendly cardiac patch monitors to the industry.
