<p>Med-Tech Innovation News sat down with&nbsp;Dr. Waqaas Al-Sadiq, CEO of Biotricity to find out more about the company, including its offering in digital health and medical devices.<br><br><strong>First of all, tell us about Biotricity?</strong></p><p>Biotricity is a remote patient monitoring company that focusses on the cardiac space. Our vision is to create a complete solution that follows cardiac patients throughout their cardiac journey. Our first product, Bioflux, is focussed on real-time diagnostics and we have a product roadmap designed to support those patients post diagnosis. At our core, we are a technology company focussed on healthcare solutions that are delivered to healthcare providers in a tech-as-a-service model.</p><p><strong>Your product line consists of four devices â€“ tell us about how they work, both individually and together, if possible?</strong></p><p>Bioflux is our core, product which is used to diagnose patients. Biocare Telemed is designed for follow up visits or to support remote prescribing of Bioflux. Bioheart is an upcoming product designed for the consumer market, for individuals diagnosed on the Bioflux or a similar diagnostic product. Lastly, we have Biocare pain management, an interactive app designed to provide patients and physicians a way to manage pain when they log in and track.</p>
