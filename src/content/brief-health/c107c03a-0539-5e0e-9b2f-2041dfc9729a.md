<p>Telehealth has been a big win all over the country during COVID-19, but not at Windrose Health Network. The CEO details all the reasons why virtual care has not taken off.<br>While use of telemedicine technologies has been soaring throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and success stories abound, not every healthcare provider organization has been satisfied with virtual care.</p><p>One example of just such a provider is Windrose Health Network, a federally qualified health center based in Greenwood, Indiana, near Indianapolis. Here's an easy way to explain the telehealth situation there: Physicians were volunteering to take eight-to-ten-hour shifts in full PPE in their open health centers, rather than do a shift of telehealth visits from the comfort of their own homes.</p><p>And there were challenges with patients, too, who prefer the hands-on treatment of an in-person visit, or who need an interpreter whose services simply work better in a three-way discussion at the same table.</p>
