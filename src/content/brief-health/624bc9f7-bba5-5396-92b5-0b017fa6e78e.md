<p>The key strategies to implement value-based healthcare, start with understanding the value, starting new projects, and accepting the variation<br><br>Over the last 15 years, there has been a movement towards value-based healthcare (VBHC) as a potential response to many of the challenges facing healthcare systems today.
Introduced in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg, the concept of VBHC at its essence is a patient-centered approach to healthcare delivery focused on improving the health outcomes that matter most to patients across the entire cycle of care.
But, what are the key strategies healthcare leaders need to follow to implement value-based healthcare (VBHC)?
In this interview, Gillian Hall, Head of Global Roche Healthcare Consulting at Roche Diagnostics International asks Professor van Eenennaam to share the top actions, mindset, and behaviors that leaders wanting to implement VBHC should embrace for success.
Prof Dr. van Eenennaam: The big question around healthcare is “why don’t we really see a relationship between what we put in and what we get out?” I think that is the burning platform: in our systems today, we have difficulties with access and see great ideas to improve healthcare implementation, but most of the time we’re still disappointed with the result.
Now, 15 years on from Porter and Teisberg’s original work, we can see that VBHC can move us toward a more sustainable healthcare system – and not at the expense of patients, taxpayers, or anything else.
So that, I think, is where we stand today and we need to continue the journey towards VBHC.</p>
