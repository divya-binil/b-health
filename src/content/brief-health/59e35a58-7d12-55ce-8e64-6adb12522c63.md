<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" data-transition="content" data-loop="false" itemprop="articleBody">        <div>      <p><em><strong>NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation, a medical technology company focused on improving surgical care options and outcomes for neurological disorders, has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance to market its Evo sEEG Electrode technology for temporary (less than 30 days) use with recording, monitoring, and stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring, and stimulation of electrical signals at the subsurface level of the brain.</strong></em></p>  <p>On&nbsp;August 9, 2022, the Company announced it had resubmitted its 510(k) application to the FDA for less than 30-day use, which included additional biocompatibility testing as requested by the FDA. On&nbsp;October 20, 2022, the company received an FDA clearance letter stating that the Evo sEEG System is substantially equivalent to the predicate device and may be marketed in&nbsp;the United States.</p>  <p>Dave Rosa, CEO of NeuroOne, said: "I am extremely proud of the entire NeuroOne team and their relentless pursuit of this clearance. Despite the challenges we faced, our team remained focused and persistent in driving this successful conclusion. This is clearly our most exciting and important accomplishment to date. We are now able to advance our commercialization efforts in partnership with Zimmer Biomet, our distribution and development partner. We look forward to continuing to execute our strategic plan, which next up includes our RF ablation system, the company's first therapeutic electrode technology.‚Äù</p>  <p>The Evo sEEG System represents the Company's second FDA 510(k) cleared product. NeuroOne now provides a full line of electrode technology to address an estimated worldwide market of&nbsp;$100 million&nbsp;for patients requiring diagnostic brain mapping procedures. As opposed to cortical electrodes, sEEG electrodes provide a similar function at the subsurface level of the brain by using a much less invasive process that does not require removal of the top portion of the patient's skull. sEEG electrodes are the predominant technology used in these procedures due to their less invasive placement and subsurface location.</p>  <p>The company's Evo Cortical and sEEG Electrodes are a portfolio of hi-definition thin film electrodes. Potential advantages include increased signal clarity and reduced noise; better tactile feedback during insertion into brain tissue; and faster order fulfilment due to an automated manufacturing process.</p>  <p>As previously reported, NeuroOne is also advancing a pipeline of therapeutic electrode technologies for brain tissue ablation and chronic stimulation use for DBS (deep brain stimulation) and spinal cord stimulation for chronic back pain.&nbsp;These therapeutic electrode technologies represent addressable markets valued between&nbsp;$500 million&nbsp;and&nbsp;$6 billion.</p>                  </div>        </div></div>
