<p>Singapore-based medtech company Us2.ai is expanding to Europe after receiving a CE mark for its automated decision support tool for echocardiography. The Us2.v1 software is an automated clinical workflow solution that identifies and analyses two-dimensional and Doppler echo images for the diagnosis, prediction, and prognosis of heart disease and pulmonary hypertension.
The company claims that its software can process and analyse images for "approximately two minutes," and then deliver a fully automated echo report with measurements, editable annotations, and conclusions for every chamber of the heart.</p>
