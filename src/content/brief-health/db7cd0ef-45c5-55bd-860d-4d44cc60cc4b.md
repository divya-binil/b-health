Some health systems foresee delayed implementation efforts because they lack the bandwidth right now to plan for them – but some technologies, particularly telehealth, are in high demand. The coronavirus pandemic is throwing a new factor into hospitals' calculations about how to proceed with current and future healthcare IT implementations.
