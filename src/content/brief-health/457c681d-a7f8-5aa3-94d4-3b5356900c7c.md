<p>Focus on what you can control, say Alvarez and Marsal Managing Directors Peter Urbanowicz and Martin McGahan. The managing editors of Alvarez &amp; Marsal, who counsel healthcare leaders on the best course of action, said that the financial problems hospitals started to experience at the beginning of the epidemic aren't going away any time soon. According to managing director Martin McGahan, the pandemic exposed the strains in the supply chain, challenges with staffing, and problems with creating safety nets. Hospitals may need to reconsider trying to be all things to all people in order to save costs, according to managing director Peter Urbanowicz. In the end, he said, CEOs and CFOs must decide how to strike a balance between their service offers and finite financial resources.
