<p>The press release announcing the publication of the report began thus: “Healthcare transactions in Q2 of 2022 reached a historic high of $19.2 billion in total transacted revenue, due largely to the planned merger of Advocate Aurora Health and Atrium Health according to ‘Kaufman Hall’s Quarterly Mergers and Acquisitions Report.’ This more than doubles the total transacted revenue of $8.5 billion in Q2 2021, which had a similar number of announced transactions.
Further, the report noted, “In three of the 13 announced Q2 transactions, the acquirer was a for-profit health system.
The report makes note of an important phenomenon that is currently emerging, around skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and long-term care facilities, in the context of a major change in federal reimbursement of care delivered in SNFs. It notes that “Recent partnerships around the provision of skilled nursing and long-term care provide an example of a new phase of healthcare partnerships with hospitals and health systems seeking transactions that offer consumers access to new services or enhance the delivery of services that require specialized skillsets.”
Indeed, the report states, “In our 2021 year-end report, we described a new phase of healthcare partnerships that extend beyond traditional horizontal partnerships between hospitals and health systems to include partnerships that can offer consumers access to new services or enhance the delivery of services that require specialized skillsets.</p>
