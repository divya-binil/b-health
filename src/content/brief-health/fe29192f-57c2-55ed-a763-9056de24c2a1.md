<p>Carey is a family nurse practitioner and mom of three. Over the last year she would see up to 100 patients during each shift at her urgent care clinic. Her patients were often frustrated and impatient, and they sometimes refused to wear a mask. Last December she was exposed to COVID-19 when her protective gear broke after being reworn too many times. Carey ultimately missed spending Christmas with her family and her employer never checked up on her during the two-week quarantine period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After hearing Carey’s story, we can’t be surprised to learn that <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.cidrap.umn.edu_news-2Dperspective_2021_04_one-2D5-2Dcovid-2Daffected-2Dhealth-2Dworkers-2Dweighs-2Dquitting-2Dstudy&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=JHHkSQuaqwDHGORnIQuaBw&amp;r=5YOstc0lpYlXTEVRRvNnZYh_BZACLPEaOBCYPMI7MEo&amp;m=f4QFboB2Uzhr1g_CbYo1sCEpS4atNkn1lqI7hj6U0zU&amp;s=Vnx7JHx5AEtfZoVwi45L0h2WSDLy0vUYMMV7fpG29Tg&amp;e=">one-in-five COVID-affected healthcare workers are now weighing quitting the practice of medicine</a>.
