<p>The pharma industry has taken a big swung into digital transformation. All participants invest in digital health topics. But as with all trending issues, and there is a lot of fuss that is hard to see through. We are trying to help you with that now.</p><p>The medical community gradually acknowledges the importance of digital health, but they don’t yet embrace it enough or cannot get behind it with such a speed as it would require. For doing so, the first step is always getting to know what’s coming. So, here are the trends changing the pharmaceutical industry in the near future.</p><h2><strong>1. Have patients in the advisory board of pharmaceutical giants</strong></h2><p>As patients take their health and through that their own future into their hands with the help of digital health, they also should be treated as equal partners in the hospitals, pharmacies – and even pharma companies. Drug producers should have an advisory board including patients who have experience with the given company’s products.</p><p>It would be easier to develop new products if the exact needs of the customers are well-known. Only with their help would it become possible to create a healthcare system that is futuristic even decades after the first plans were drawn.</p>
