<p>Thai private healthcare provider Thonburi Hospital has signed a memorandum of understanding with Chunghwa Telecom Co., a Taiwan-based telecommunications company, for their continued collaboration in the hospital's digital transformation.
Powered by Taiwanese medical AI firm imedtac and medical device company MD Healthcare from Thailand, Chunghwa is able to deliver smart ward solutions to Thonburi Hospital, including a smart nursing station, an all-in-one vital sign kiosk, an automated dispensing cabinet, an e-paper bedside information display and a ToF fall management system.
So far, the smart hospital applications provided by Chunghwa have reduced the workload burden for the staff of Thonburi Hospital, enhanced the quality of medical services, and raised its operational performance.</p>
