Addressing established uncertainty amongst payers and providers on the future of bundled payments, Chilmark’s latest report analyzes the market trends shaping this space and describes available IT solutions to help healthcare organizations (HCOs) adapt to these new value-based payment programs.</p><p><a href="https://www.chilmarkresearch.com/what-are-bundled-payments-and-are-they-here-to-stay/">These models vary</a> depending on payer, providers and type of service.
