<p>– Created to close the massive access and quality gap in neurological care, Neura Health announced it has raised $2.2M in seed funding from investors Pear VC (Doordash, Guardant Health), Norwest Venture Partners (Calm, Talkspace), Global Founders Capital, Index Ventures (Figma, Robinhood), &nbsp;digital health expert Nikhil Krishnan, and Next Play Ventures, the fund of former LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner.
Frustrated by personal experiences with chronic neurological conditions, co-founders Elizabeth Burstein and Sameer Madan built Neura Health to close the massive access and quality gap in neurological care.
Neura Health’s product is a platform that connects patients to neurologists, with in-built neurology-specific symptom monitoring and condition-specific diagnostic tests.
Neura Health has HIPAA-compliant text messaging and video visits, with a care concierge service to help patients with their various needs.
“With 24/7 access to a personalized care team through Neura Health, patients can avoid long wait lists and find relief with a trusted partner,” said Elizabeth Burstein, CEO and Co-founder of Neura Health.</p>
