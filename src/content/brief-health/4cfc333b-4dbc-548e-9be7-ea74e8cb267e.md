The Biden administration is proposing to increase the penalty for hospitals that don&#39;t comply with a federal rule requiring them to publicly post the prices of their procedures. The rule, which was written by the Trump administration and published in 2019, was praised for its attempt to shine a light on the opaque world of hospital pricing. 

Advocates criticized the Trump-era effort for not having enough teeth behind it because the penalties were so low. They hope the new proposal could have a bigger impact on driving down costs.
