<p>The pandemic has turned the spotlight on inaccessible, unusable, patient data. It's time to accept the reality that this is a comorbidity. Almost three years into the epidemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 1 million Americans have died as a result of COVID-19, while the World Health Organization estimates that more than 6.6 million people have perished worldwide. Both estimates fail to account for the potential long-term health impacts of COVID, according to several analysts, who place the real number of deaths brought on by COVID much higher than these figures. Inaccessible, useless patient data is one of the main obstacles to avoiding and managing illnesses, such as COVID-19 infections, hospitalisations, and fatalities. Despite Californians saying that the quality of their care has improved this year compared to last year, the United States' lack of complete, timely, useable, and secure digital information is probably the biggest obstacle to enhancing health and enhancing our capacity to make decisions.</p>
