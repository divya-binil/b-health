Flicking your wrist as your smartwatch nudges you, you find a notification alerting that it’s time to take your digital pill. You grab one from your smart medicine pack, alert your GP, and ingest it with a glass of water. Thereafter, the pill broadcasts a real-time video stream as it goes down your oesophagus and into your stomach. Your GP is simultaneously monitoring the visuals, assessing the progression of your ulcer. 

Afterwards, you have a video call with your GP who reassures you of the ulcer’s healing. She also notes that the digital pill contains your personalised medicine 3D-printed onto it and it will slowly get activated with your stomach’s activity. Before leaving, she reminds you to stick to the prescribed treatment plan for the best outcome. It’s a nice reminder that she’ll be monitoring your adherence via the pill’s tracking sensor.
