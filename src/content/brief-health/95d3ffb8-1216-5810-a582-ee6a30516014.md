<p>The company seeks to meet the rising demand for specialised care across Southeast Asia. Asian Healthcare Specialists, a comprehensive medical care organisation, has been fully acquired by Singaporean telehealth startup Doctor Anywhere, which is listed on Catalist. This company has 12 clinics in Singapore and provides a variety of specialised treatments, including anaesthesia, dermatology, family medicine, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, otorhinolaryngology, rehabilitation, and urology. Its 14 medical experts, one family doctor, and one physical therapist will be merged into DA's expanding network of 3,000 general practitioners and specialists. DA claims that its most recent acquisition is a component of its effort to fulfil the expanding demand for specialised care throughout Southeast Asia. To advance its work on creating a technologically enabled regional healthcare ecosystem, it will continue to look for synergistic possibilities and targeted purchases of essential healthcare assets throughout the region.</p>
