<p>Moving into 2022, healthcare collections have the opportunity to connect with patients on a human level – treating the patient with humanity and empathy as is done within the four walls of the exam room.
This year, healthcare organizations must prioritize RCM partnerships and technologies, which emphasize empathy and put the patient first.
Over the last few years, revenue cycle management has started to change, reevaluating processes on how to make it easier for patients to pay, rather than continuing outdated processes that historically prioritized the easiest path for the collector.
RCM quickly moved from a “pay now” mentality, to meeting patients where they are – ensuring care regardless of immediate ability to pay.
– Upfront connection: In the past, discussions around payment and collections have been siloed to after the point of service, trying – often without much success – to reach the patient after they leave the hospital.
– Finding the right partner: Finding an industry partner with scalable technology capabilities, as well as a mission in empathy and working alongside patients is key in finding success – both for supporting the bottom line and ensuring convenience in payment for the patient.
Ensuring patients know they have access to healthcare while using technology and facilitating partnerships to ensure the most seamless process for administrators and patients alike, will be key.</p>
