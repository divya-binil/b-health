<p>At Oslo University Hospital (OUH), an advanced mechanism for labelling and editing recorded procedures has been developed in partnership with Olympus to support the standardisation of procedures and enhance teaching workflows for surgeons.
Projects such as this OUH/Olympus partnership are helping to transform operating rooms into valuable data sources, which in turn can be used in the development of AI solutions without requiring further editing or labelling.
Removing this expensive and time-consuming barrier with a simple, automated tool will help to build a foundation for future AI solutions that improve patient safety, clinical outcomes and the efficiency of surgical procedures.</p>
