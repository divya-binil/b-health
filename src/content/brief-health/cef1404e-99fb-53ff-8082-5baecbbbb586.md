<p>This HIMSS panel at HIMSS21 APAC focused on the role of digital tools in addressing issues around mental health and driving better outcomes.<br><br>Fung talked about the use of digital tools in addressing mental illness and mental health problems â€“ the former which is a disease afflicting certain portions of the population and the latter which is stress-driven and in the present case, pandemic-induced.
But Fung differentiated such online tools from "digital mental health systems that [are dealing] with illnesses, [those trying to] improve surveillance or do interventions".
"But we also have mental health and mental illness issues in the working adult population and the elderly," Fung stressed, referring to people who are digital migrants or refugees who are not technologically literate.</p>
