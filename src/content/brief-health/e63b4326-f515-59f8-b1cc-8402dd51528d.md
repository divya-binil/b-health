<p>EHR, health IT analytics, mHealth, and health IT security experts shared their insights into what healthcare leaders can expect in 2023. Healthcare Strategies was informed by experts that in 2023, leaders in EHR, health IT analytics, mHealth, and health IT security may witness a surge in innovation centred on easing provider load and addressing healthcare consumerism. For additional information, listen to the entire podcast. Don't forget to subscribe on Google Podcasts, Spotify, or iTunes. Frank Harvey, CEO of Surescripts, said that in 2023, the emphasis will still be on enhancing EHR interoperability. Healthcare organisations will be motivated to streamline procedures and lighten the pressure on providers as the number of healthcare workers declines.</p>
