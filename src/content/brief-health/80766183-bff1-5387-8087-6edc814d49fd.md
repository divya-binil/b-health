<p>From medicines to tests, from lab equipment to bandages, this healthcare supply chain works day and night to ensure that frontline healthcare workers and providers have the equipment they need when they need it for their patients.
To our advantage, the relentless march of technology is well-placed to help address some of these issues, and there are several companies, from startups to established players, who are making strides to improve the efficiency, speed, and quality of various aspects of the healthcare supply chain.
Letâ€™s take a closer look at a few of these companies, and what kinds of solutions they are bringing to improve the healthcare supply chain.
The US-based startup ConnectSx provides software solutions to hospitals that help to address these challenges in the medical device supply chain.
Managing supply chains within healthcare often means exchanging sensitive information between companies and suppliers, and among supply chain networks.
</p><p>This provides a single platform for all complete supply chain network members, allowing them to securely and transparently share critical documents.
The COVID-19 outbreak challenged healthcare supply chains around the world, and placed significant strain on the movement of medical equipment and supplies, which were much needed.
Singapore-based supply chain specialist ZirconMed uses artificial intelligence to help their customers more accurately trace the movement of their products.
What is clear is that, in order to restore trust, companies need to take action that not only helps mitigate the challenges today but also helps to future-proof these supply chains against unknown disruptions tomorrow.
The companies highlighted above, and many more, are proactively leveraging the flexibility and power of digital technology to help to create the more intelligent and dependable supply chains needed for healthcare products worldwide.
These tools and solutions not only provide companies the opportunity to improve the efficiency of their operations and implement cost-saving measures, but they also help to make sure that the supply chain is more resilient and crisis-proof.</p>
