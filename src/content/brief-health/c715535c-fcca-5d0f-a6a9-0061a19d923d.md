      We were motivated to start Carium by the realization that something had to
      change. People lack the information, support, and encouragement they need
      to seek healthcare services, and to make healthy, informed decisions every
      day.


      Our team was purpose-built to catalyze powerful change, with expertise in
      clinical transformation, patient engagement, behavior change science, and
      cutting-edge technology.

<p>First, Smith had to address the biggest challenge of all: How could she direct those dollars to build health equity and improve engagement for the underserved community that depends on OmniPoint Health?
Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) like OmniPoint Health have one of the most important and difficult jobs in healthcare: bridging the many gaps that prevent underserved patients from accessing healthcare services in rural communities.
Staffing was sparse throughout the nation, pandemic pressures were building, and expectations from federal funders were high as health equity earned much-needed time in the spotlight.</p>
