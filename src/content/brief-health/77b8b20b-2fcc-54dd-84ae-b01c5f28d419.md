<p>Professor Jung In Park of the University of California, Irvine's School of Nursing, a pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence to improve care, talks about how AI is advancing nursing and how to get ready for a time when it will be used more frequently. Up until 2030, the market for healthcare AI is anticipated to expand by 37% yearly. In spite of the fact that, as of 2021, just one-fifth of healthcare organisations globally had adopted AI models, there is an increasing need and opportunity to apply AI to advance patient care and medicine. One way nurses are being forced to adapt as the industry evolves is by becoming more tech savvy. The Sue &amp; Bill Gross School of Nursing at the University of California, Irvine, is a pioneer in the use of AI and machine learning to enhance care.</p>
