<p>AristaMD, a provider of eConsult and referral management services in the field of digital healthcare, today announced the opening of a centralised platform for care transition. The platform combines electronic referral processing, eConsults, and patient-to-provider matching into a single interoperable solution for primary care providers. (PCPs). The end-to-end referral solution makes sure that every patient receives timely care from the appropriate physician in the appropriate location and that patients who have problems that can be treated through a peer consultation can obtain care directly from their primary care provider. PCPs can ask virtual experts for advice on particular patient cases via AristaMD eConsults, and responses are provided within hours. In more than 73% of eConsults, the PCP is able to treat the patient right away without a referral.</p>
