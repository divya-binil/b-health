<p>The Elevate percutaneous Left Ventricular Assist Device (pLVAD) was used in the FDA-approved Early Feasibility Study for the high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (HR-PCI) indication by Magenta Medical, the company that created the smallest heart pump in the world. Two patients were treated as part of the study's initial phase: one at New York's Mount Sinai Health System and the other at St. Francis Hospital and Heart Centre. In order to enhance their quality of life and lower their risk of heart attacks, patients with coronary artery disease are frequently referred for a catheterization procedure to clear blockages in the arteries that supply their hearts. Some of these patients have more severe disease when they first arrive, which puts them at higher risk for instability during coronary intervention.</p>
