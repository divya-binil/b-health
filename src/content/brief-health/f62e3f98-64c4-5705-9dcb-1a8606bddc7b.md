<p>This widespread scarcity of healthcare workers is forcing providers to cope by having practitioners handle tasks like data entry along with their normal patient care duties.
Workflow automation removes manual steps that chip away from healthcare professionals’ time and helps eliminate the need for human intervention in certain areas of work.
As a result, providers can avoid human error, and employees can spend less time on mundane tasks — all while maintaining HIPAA compliance.
With most physicians seeing more than 20 patients per day, mundane data entry consumes valuable time providers should use on billable services or patient care instead.
Statistics show that 73% of IT leaders believe that automation helps their employees save up to 50% of their time on manual tasks.
Automating work lets providers spend more time caring for patients and logging billable hours.
Workflow automation can help build better work experiences by automating the manual tasks that would otherwise burden healthcare professionals.
Healthcare organizations should consider adopting workflow automation to reduce manual toil, mitigate human error, increase security and improve talent acquisition.</p>
