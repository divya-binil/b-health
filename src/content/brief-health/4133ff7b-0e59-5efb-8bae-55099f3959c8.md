<p>Utilizing the most technologically advanced Master Patient Index (MPI) process, 4medica has revolutionized how organizations can analyze, improve, and utilize health data.
However, by applying AI and ML technology in the second and third layers to catch more errors and improve eMPI scoring weights, 4medica’s platform can reduce duplication rates to as low as 1% to 3% and work through high volumes of data much faster.
Built to process unlimited patient identities, the 4medica Big Data MPI is ideal for health information exchanges (HIEs), large hospital systems, labs, clinics and other healthcare organizations that must manage tens of millions of patient records each year.
“Harnessing advanced technologies such as AI, ML and automation through the cloud is the most effective and cost-efficient way for an organization to improve the quality and the value of its data.”</p>
