<p>The Roadmap, based on feedback Secretary Becerra received from patients and providers on the National Tour to Strengthen Mental Health, describes policy solutions that would help to better incorporate mental health and substance use care into the larger healthcare system and other systems. The result is a Roadmap that aims to ensure that the full spectrum of behavioral healthcare will be integrated into the healthcare, social service, and early childhood systems to ensure all people have equitable access to evidence-based, culturally appropriate, person-centered care.‚Äù
In order to ensure equity in access to affordable, high-quality, culturally appropriate care for mental health and substance use, we must fully integrate behavioral health into the larger healthcare system and other systems.</p>
