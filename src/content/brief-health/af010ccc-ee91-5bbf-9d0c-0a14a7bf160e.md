<p>Amazon Pharmacy's MedsYourWay discount card, administered by InsideRx, is offered through Prime Therapeutics and its Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan clients.
With MedsYourWay, Amazon Pharmacy makes it seamless for customers to use their discount card and get the most out of their benefits, he noted.
Eligible Blue Plan members who select Amazon as their pharmacy will enjoy a simplified sign-up experience, real-time plan-specific pricing on prescription medications, and 24/7 access to our pharmacists, according to the company.
Amazon Pharmacy aims to tackle the barriers that make it difficult for patients to get their medications and stay adherent, Ayogu said.</p>
