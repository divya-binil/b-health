<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has stifled many activities and elements in our daily lives. Technology, on the other hand, has rapidly adapted and evolved to fill many of the gaps created by social distancing and the increased need for healthcare access.&nbsp;</p><p>The unprecedented events of this year have particularly elevated the role of chat and voice solutions in the healthcare context. These solutions are designed to enhance communication and deliver more control and knowledge directly into the hands of patients. As healthcare providers grapple with overwhelming hospitalization rates and a high volume of patient questions and concerns, chat and voice solutions are positioned to reduce administrative burdens and assist in remote patient monitoring.&nbsp;</p>
