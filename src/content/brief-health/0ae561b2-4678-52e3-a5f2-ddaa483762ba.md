<p>“Despite forces not within our control, namely the thoughts and actions of others, headway has been made in my local practice area:&nbsp; the decline in mortality, the advances in clinical knowledge about the pathophysiology, more efficient testing, more PPE, an uprooting and great revealing of the need for prioritization of health care worker wellness, the impact of stress and isolation on health, the magnification of health care disparities, racism, and sexism, an opportunity for the interweaving connection of humanity for some, along with the stark divisiveness that continues to exist.&nbsp; But we get to choose how this pandemic plays out for us.&nbsp; I choose extreme caution, gratitude for this opportunity for temporary seclusion, an opportunity to recharge while reconnecting.&nbsp; I wait in the uncertainty.”</p>
