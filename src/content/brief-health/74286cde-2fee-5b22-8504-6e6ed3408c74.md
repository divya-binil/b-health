<p>Ethics and human rights must be a part of the design, deployment, and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the delivery of healthcare, according to the World Health Organisation’s first global report on AI in health. The WHO report, <a href="https://worldhealthorganization.cmail19.com/t/d-l-qkrait-juqjhhjjh-r/"><i>Ethics and governance of artificial intelligence for health</i></a><i>, </i>was<i> </i>released June 28th, and is the result of two years of consultations by international experts.</p><p>“Like all new technology, artificial intelligence holds enormous potential for improving the health of millions of people around the world, but like all technology it can also be misused and cause harm,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This important new report provides a valuable guide for countries on how to maximise the benefits of AI, while minimising its risks and avoiding its pitfalls.”</p>
