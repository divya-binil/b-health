title: How Has COVID-19 Impacted the Value-Based Care Movement?

Federal health officials have not kept secret their desire to link healthcare payments to value-based care, with the Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) saying last year that they want to have 100 percent of providers taking on some downside financial risk by 2025. Currently, however, less than 20 percent of Medicare spending is value-based, meaning $1 trillion of healthcare risk will be shifting from the government to hospitals, health systems, and physician practices across the U.S., should CMSâ€™ benchmarks be met, according to a new report released by Coverys, a Boston-based provider of medical professional liability insurance.
