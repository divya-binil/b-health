<p>Roche will leverage PicnicHealth's real-world datasets for Alzheimer’s Disease, Alzheimer’s Disease-related dementia and myasthenia gravis. In order to accelerate the study of neurological diseases, the pharma behemoth Roche and its affiliate Genentech are expanding their relationship globally through investments in real-world data. Patients can access their health history with PicnicHealth and donate their de-identified medical data to clinical research. Roche will make use of PicnicHealth's most recent real-world datasets for dementias linked to Alzheimer's disease, myasthenia gravis, a persistent autoimmune condition that causes skeletal muscle weakness. The records will be utilised in Roche's pan-neuroscience patient research project to provide details on unmet demands and difficulties patients with neurological illnesses encounter. We're happy to continue our long-standing collaboration with Roche and Genentech as we use our knowledge of working with patients to gather data and help researchers better understand the course of disease.</p>
