<p>The government relations team at HIMSS offers some insights on what's next for telehealth, broadband expansion, interoperability rules and more in the year ahead. HIMSS claims it is now prepared to argue for permanent coverage of virtual care because Congress included telehealth waivers in its omnibus budget package at the end of 2022, delaying the "telehealth cliff" for two years.
