<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' continued efforts to enhance patient care through improved data access and efficient data management have the backing of HIMSS (CMS). The proposed CMS authorisation rule should give patients more access to and control over their data, extend patients' access to comprehensive health records to providers and payers, and lessen the administrative cost of managing information throughout the healthcare ecosystem. HIMSS submitted written comments to the 0938-AU87 CMS 0057 Advancing Interoperability and Improving Prior Authorization Processes for Medicare Advantage Organizations, Medicaid Managed Care Plans, State Medicaid Agencies, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Agencies and CHIP Managed Care Entities, Issuers of Qualified Health Plans on the Federally Facilitated Exchanges, and Merit-Based Incentive Program Entities (NPRM).</p>
