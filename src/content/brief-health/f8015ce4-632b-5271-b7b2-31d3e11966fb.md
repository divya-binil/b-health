<p>A study published this month in <i>JMIR Human Factors</i> from Syracuse University researchers found that physicians are in favor of expanding telehealth permanently. &nbsp;</p><p>However, many docs also voiced concerns with limitations of current telehealth technology offerings, noting that market concentration could lead to weighted effects of select platforms' capabilities.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>"As consumers, we want competition which reduces the price and increases the quality," said lead author Bhavneet Walia, assistant professor of public health at Syracuse, about the <a href="https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/26336">study</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>"On one hand, from this survey, I believe telehealth can increase access," she said. "On the other hand, as a health economist, I worry that market concentration will reduce access." &nbsp;</p>
