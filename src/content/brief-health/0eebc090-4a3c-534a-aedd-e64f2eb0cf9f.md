The Aster Innovation and Research Centre, the innovation hub of the Aster DM Healthcare Group, has teamed up with Intel Corporation and AI platform provider CARPL.ai to develop and roll out an AI-powered health data platform in India. The health data platform is based on federated learning, a machine learning technique that trains AI algorithms across multiple decentralised sources holding local data samples without exchanging them. Although AI solutions in medical imaging have proven to be helpful in resolving pressing healthcare issues such as staff shortages, accessing silos of data across healthcare institutions, locations, and other health systems while complying with regulatory policies remains a &quot;massive challenge,&quot; according to Aster DM. By providing access to huge datasets, Aster DM&#39;s federated learning-based platform enables organisations to collaborate in developing AI-enabled health tech solutions, further boosting innovation in areas such as drug discovery, diagnosis, genomics, and predictive healthcare. Its recent pilot, according to Aster DM, has also shown how the platform is able to &quot;democratise access to health data across organisational and geographical boundaries without compromising on data privacy and security aspects&quot;.
