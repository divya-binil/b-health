<p>The solution is based on an AI technology that has been trained based on a data set of 3.2 billion patient visits. California-based medical AI startup Aesop Technology, which has an R&amp;D office in Taiwan, has recently unveiled its latest clinical documentation improvement tool that helps coders spot incorrectly coded diagnoses or procedures.
According to Aesop Technology, their latest solution for medical coding harnesses AI to "efficiently compensate for traditional CDSS and NLP weaknesses to find correct or missed diagnoses".
Now available on digital health marketplace Olive Library, DxPrime provides information on missing and wrongly coded diagnoses or procedures to easily correct patients' charts.
Jim Long, CEO of Aesop, said: "Physicians, CDI team, and coders have to spend a lot of time poring through medical records to find the key clinical diagnoses among the vast amount of information available.</p>
