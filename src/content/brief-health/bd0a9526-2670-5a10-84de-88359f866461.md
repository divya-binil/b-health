<p>For industry stakeholders, the year ahead will be a challenging one as they get ready to comply with new federal rules on interoperability and patient access that aim to grant patients direct access to their health data. The regulations, which begin taking effect in 2021 and will continue into 2022, are expected to significantly shake up the healthcare interoperability landscape. For instance, the Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard has been a bright spot in health IT for the past several years, and now, the rules will mandate that health IT developers build FHIR-based APIs (application programming interfaces) so that patients can access critical health data.</p>
