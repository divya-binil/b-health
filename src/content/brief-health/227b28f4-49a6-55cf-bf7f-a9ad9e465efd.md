<p>Can you image people had to wait for other people's death to have a new liver? And drugs were not personalised and you could die of cancer?!<br><br><a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/healthcare-in-2060/">Read on medicalfuturist.com</a>I receive many questions after my talks and on my online channels about the not yet visible future.
