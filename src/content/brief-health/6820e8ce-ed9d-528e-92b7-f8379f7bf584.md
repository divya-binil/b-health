<p>The Cloud Security Alliance this past week <a href="http://ealthcareitnews.com/">released a report</a> outlining the cyber risks faced by healthcare delivery organizations when it comes to supply chain management.</p><p>Experts from CSA explained that healthcare organizations face two main concerns:</p><ul><li>Risk management involving the cyber supply chain, which includes IT networks, hardware and software.</li><li>Risk management involving the conventional supply chain.</li></ul><p>"With the move to the cloud and edge computing, HDOs are finding it increasingly challenging to secure their infrastructure," read the report.</p><p>"Cyberattacks target HDOs and their suppliers in this expanded attack surface," it continued. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>As the report authors noted, cyberattacks can be very costly, particularly as healthcare organizations and suppliers present juicy targets for bad actors. &nbsp;</p><p>And as the supply chain has become more dependent on the Internet, the risk profile has also become more complex. &nbsp;</p><p>"It is incumbent on HDOs to ensure that their supply chain partners comply with data management policies and ensure the safety and security of the supply chain," said report authors. &nbsp;</p><p>They explored several causes for supply chain and risk management program failure: &nbsp;</p><ol><li>A lack of automation, which makes keeping up with cyber threats challenging.</li><li>The cost and time-consumption of vendor risk-assessments.</li><li>Partial or full failure to deploy critical vendor-management controls and processes</li></ol><p>"Regardless of the reason, it is imperative HDOs have an effective supply chain risk-management program to manage the process throughout the supply chain risk-assessment life cycle," said the report.</p><p>That life cycle, it continued, comprises determining criteria for supplier evaluation, assessing and treating risk, and monitoring and responding to further developments. &nbsp;</p><p>"We must engage with our supply chain vendors to address tactical and systemic security performance measures necessary to achieve a satisfactory risk rating,‚Äù said the report. &nbsp;</p><p>"Additionally, we must reduce our risk exposure by holding our supply chain accountable to meeting our risk management performance standards. &nbsp;</p><p>"Risk feedback to vendors that is timely, relevant and actionable is a powerful motivator for supply chain vendors to do the right thing," it continued. &nbsp;</p>
