<p>The legislation seeks to offer workers stand-alone telehealth benefits, similar to dental and vision plans. The Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 would all be modified by the Telehealth Benefit Expansion for Workers Act to permit employers to recognise benefits for telehealth services as exempted benefits. The law aims to preserve stand-alone telehealth benefits distinct and not to offer them in place of medical plans as excepted benefits under group health insurance or group health plans. According to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services FAQs for insurance agents and brokers, an exempted benefit permits employers to pay for additional medical treatment, such as vision or dental coverage, requiring Congress to change prior public health and funding regulations.</p>
