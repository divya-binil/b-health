<p>Heritage Clinic, a behavioral health provider, gives tablets to help patients connect with their clinicians and with their families. The effort enables measurable improvements in mental health.<br><br>Pasadena, California-based Heritage Clinic, a division of the Center for Aging Resources, provides mental health services in Los Angeles County to older adults experiencing substantive and persistent mental health concerns.</p><p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong></p><p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, many services were provided in the clients' homes or elsewhere in the field. For some who are unable to leave their home for a variety of reasons, their session with their clinician was one of the&nbsp;few social interactions in their lives.</p><p>Others are homeless, without the security of four walls.&nbsp;They brave the elements and potential violence on the streets. Many have multiple medical issues further complicating their lives.</p><p>"For all of these reasons, our clients are some of the most vulnerable people in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic," said Robyn East, financial analyst at Heritage Clinic. "Providing services to them in person would put them at risk of exposure, despite all of the precautions staff might have taken. With the stay-at-home order, clients were more isolated than ever before."</p>
