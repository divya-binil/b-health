<p>We believe that to keep pace with tech giants like Amazon, traditional providers must excel equally at providing superior quality of care as well as bringing technology to the forefront.
Instead of just talking about value-based care, it’s high time healthcare players start acting on it now as the new entrants will continue to innovate to cater to the evolving consumer needs and reinvent the patient experience.
When so much is at stake improved patient outcomes, enhanced efficacy, delivering value-based care, staying competitive they will soon become obsolete unless traditional healthcare companies adopt technology at its core.
One of the essential steps that traditional players can take is to start preparing for a fundamental shift in how patient care is delivered and how consumers will demand services.
In a world driven by digital, players who can reinvent their business models with a new and innovative approach to address consumers’ needs by embracing emerging technologies will be the only ones to survive and not be steamrolled by tech behemoths.</p>
