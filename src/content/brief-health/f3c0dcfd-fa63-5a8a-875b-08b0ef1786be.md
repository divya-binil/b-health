<p>HIMSS and Indonesia’s Ministry of Health are working to enhance regulations, technologies, human resources and health infrastructures as part of Indonesia’s digital health transformation. The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia has created the Blueprint of Digital Health Transformation Strategy 2024, laying the groundwork for the country’s digitalization of health services to expand inclusive healthcare coverage.
HIMSS has kicked off projects with the Indonesia Healthcare Corporation, Siloam Hospitals Group and Rumah Sakit Pondok Indah Group to measure their digital health maturity and capacity. The long-awaited reunion of the healthcare community in Asia Pacific has added emphasis on accelerating the digital transformation of healthcare in Indonesia.</p>
