<p>Platforms for telehealth helped blur the level of expertise among medical establishments; therefore, the treatment quality of grassroots healthcare establishments in districts will be raised to be equivalent to large hospitals in big cities. The first hospital in Vietnam to utilise telemedicine is Medical University Hospital in Hanoi. More than 300 patients have been seen by doctors in various minor hospitals over the course of four months. Colleagues and a large portion of the general public were drawn to the hospital's live social media broadcasts. In 2017, the hospital in the Mekong Delta Province of An Giang put this strategy into practise. Hospitals and other medical facilities have implemented the project for delivery. The doctors at the hospital set up devices with stethoscopes and the ability to wirelessly stream newborns' heart-lung sounds into one app, which would subsequently filter abnormal heart noises. The Hanoi Medical University Hospital doctor will re-listen to the heart sound in these situations.</p>
