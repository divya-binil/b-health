<p>The prediction was made at the same time as Renfrewshire's Advanced Production Innovation District Scotland (AMIDS), home of CPI, a technology innovation organisation, inaugurated its centre for innovation in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The centre, which has received £88 million in funding from public and commercial partners, will house experts in cutting-edge research and technology. It seeks to hasten innovation in drug development and production. The facility's "grand challenge" business model adheres to the UK Life Sciences Strategy roadmap and combines concepts from the pharmaceutical and technology industries to help address issues like accelerating and personalising the production of medicines and improving manufacturing process sustainability. In the centre of AMIDS, the centre is located next to the National Manufacturing Institute Scotland.</p>
