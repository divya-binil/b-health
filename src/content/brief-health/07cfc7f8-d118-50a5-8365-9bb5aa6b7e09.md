<p>Learn how a neonatal telehealth program can increase the access to and quality of care for some of your most vulnerable patients.<br><br>How Neonatal Telehealth Can Reduce Costs and Benefit Mother and Child</p><p>Giving birth can be extremely stressful for some mothers, especially when they lack access to neonatal care. According to recent statistics, around 10% of babies born in the United States are considered preterm. 8.6% of all babies have a low birthweight, 20% of all infant deaths are due to a birth defect, and around 14.5% of all mothers do not receive any neonatal care.</p><p>Many birthing facilities do not have access to on-site neonatal care. If the infant needs urgent medical care, providers may have to wait for a transport team to arrive on the scene to stabilize the child. Many providers may also transport infants to a local specialist unnecessarily, raising costs, and adding stress to both the mother and child.</p><p>Instead of waiting for in-person assistance or transporting newborns to neonatal facilities, some providers may be able to use neonatal telehealth instead. Providers will be able to remotely consult with neonatal specialists using live video and audio, giving them immediate access to the expertise they need to stabilize and care for the infant.</p>
