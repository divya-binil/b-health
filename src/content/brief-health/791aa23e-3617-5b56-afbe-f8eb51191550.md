<p>For example, surgical planning and navigation have improved consistently through computed tomography (CT), ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), while minimally invasive surgery (MIS), combined with robotic assistance, resulted in decreased surgical trauma and improved patient recovery.
AI assist through surgical robotics
Designed to assist during operations with surgical instruments’ manipulation and positioning, AI-driven surgical robots are computer-manipulated devices that allow surgeons to focus on the complex aspects of a surgery.
Asensus Surgical has a performance-guided laparoscopic AI robot that provides information back to surgeons, such as size of tissue, rather than requiring a physical measuring tap.
At the same time, human skills are used for programming these robots by demonstration – and for teaching them by imitating operations conducted by surgeons.
In a second stage, surgical robots recognize, model and conduct the sub-tasks in a sequential mode, hence providing human surgeons with a break from repetitive tasks.
