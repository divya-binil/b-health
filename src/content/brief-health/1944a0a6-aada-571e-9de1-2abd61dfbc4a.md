    description: >-
      We were motivated to start Carium by the realization that something had to
      change. People lack the information, support, and encouragement they need
      to seek healthcare services, and to make healthy, informed decisions every
      day.


      Our team was purpose-built to catalyze powerful change, with expertise in
      clinical transformation, patient engagement, behavior change science, and
      cutting-edge technology.

The FCC COVID-19 Telehealth Program and HRSA grants helped defray the cost of implementing telehealth services and began to bridge the digital divide in healthcare. This level of financial support will have a lasting positive impact. As a result, Carium recommends further investment to continue to evaluate and expand the impact of digital health in underserved communities. The uptick in telehealth use during the pandemic, and the data supporting improved outcomes and accessibility, demonstrates the value and need for permanent federal virtual care policies that support reimbursement.  </span></p><p id="viewer-eq6n"><span><strong>Tech equity</strong> The increase of digital health technology signals a promising trend in helping address barriers to access. However, many of these tools rely on access to high-speed broadband, smartphones, and digital health literacy. To successfully integrate digital health into community healthcare,  patients must have easy access and a basic understanding of  how to use technology to avoid creating additional barriers to equitable care. Honored for this opportunity to provide feedback to the OSTP on strengthening community health through technology,  Carium looks forward to future, continued collaborations with the federal government, healthcare systems, and practices as they work together to identify opportunities and solutions to address these difficult challenges.
