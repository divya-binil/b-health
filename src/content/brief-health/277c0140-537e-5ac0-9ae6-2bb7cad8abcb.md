<p>"As healthcare providers continue to navigate and find ways to improve the telehealth experience, we have to be intentional about bringing all voices to the table," one expert says.
"Prioritizing health equity is key to the future of healthcare, because there is a significant opportunity for healthcare providers to improve and dismantle inequalities and help people be their best selves," Land believes.
 Providing resources and access to healthcare based on patient feedback and how they are able to engage with healthcare resources ultimately will allow the system to correlate equity and efficiency. &nbsp;By allowing patients to engage with healthcare providers in their preferred method, there is an opportunity to more actively and intentionally engage patients, families and team members in health practices and disease-targeted telehealth sessions.
As healthcare providers continue to navigate and find ways to improve the telehealth experience, we have to be intentional about bringing all voices to the table.
This techequity challenge impacts access to healthcare and access to telehealth.</p>
