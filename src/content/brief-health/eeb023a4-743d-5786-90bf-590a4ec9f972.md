<p>The combination of simple technology and good service is helping to make remote patient monitoring (RPM) a key part of keeping patients healthy for primary care physicians. The team at <a href="https://www.augusta.edu/mcg/">Medical College of Georgia</a> at Augusta University rolled out RPM and has seen a drop in avoidable ED visits and improved patient experience.</p><p><i>Healthcare IT Today </i>sat down with Dr. Janis Coffin, Chief Transformation Officer and professor at Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, Department of Family Medicine to learn more about their successful implementation and how RPM fits into their patient workflow.</p><p><strong>RPM fueled by Chronic Care Management</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/infographic/chronic-diseases.htm">According to the CDC</a>, 6 out of 10 adults in the US have a chronic disease and 4 out of 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases (heart disease, cancer, COPD, diabetes, etc). Chronic diseases are the leading cause of death and is a significant driver of the $3.8 Trillion spent on health care in the US.</p><p>In 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (<a href="https://www.cms.gov/">CMS</a>) introduced a program for non-complex <a href="https://www.cms.gov/outreach-and-education/medicare-learning-network-mln/mlnproducts/downloads/chroniccaremanagement.pdf">Chronic Care Management</a> (CCM). Under this program, Medicare patients with two or more chronic conditions could receive non-face-to-face service from a healthcare provider to prevent chronic conditions from worsening. The program would reimburse the provider for 20 minutes per month for this remote service.</p>
