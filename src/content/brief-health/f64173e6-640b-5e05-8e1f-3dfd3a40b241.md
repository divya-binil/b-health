<p>Immediately upon being elected, U.S. President Joe Biden had a task to solve. Amidst taking a hold on the virus, he, however, did not forget about a health issue he’d previously been involved in. In his first major address to Congress this April, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(21)00282-5/fulltext">Biden asked</a> lawmakers to help him “<i>end cancer as we know it.</i>” The U.S.’s ambition to stop cancer deaths began with the project <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/cancermoonshot">Moonshot</a> Biden was responsible for under the presidency of Barack Obama. While Moonshot hasn’t yet proved successful, the amount of money spent on research has its mark on the outcome.</p><p>The United States spends more money on cancer than any other country. Globally, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jncics/article/3/4/pkz069/5582653">44% of cancer research funders</a> are located in the United States (21% in Europe, 16% in Asia). Cancer is the <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/cancer#tab=tab_1">second leading cause of death</a> worldwide; every 6th death is caused by a form of the disease. It poses a physical, emotional and financial burden on individuals, families, societies and governments.</p>
