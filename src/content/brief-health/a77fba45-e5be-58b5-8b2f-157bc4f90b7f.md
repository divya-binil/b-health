<p>We need creative thinking in the healthcare industry, even if it comes from the digital giants. In her efforts to use Google's influence as a tech platform for the advancement of public health, Karen DeSalvo, chief health officer at Google, has often referred to correct information access as "a determinant of health."

But in order to achieve what DeSalvo referred to as "a doctor in your pocket," which entails easy access to our electronic health records (EHR), real-time chat, or personalised care plans, incumbents in healthcare technology must experience a sense of competition-driven fear sparked by novel technologies that drive significant change.</p>
