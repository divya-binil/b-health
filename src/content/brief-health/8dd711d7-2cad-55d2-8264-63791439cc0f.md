<p>AI-enabled imaging company Aidoc scooped up $110 million in a Series D funding round.
The round was led by TCV and Alpha Intelligence Capital with participation from AIC's co-investor CDIB Capital. The investment, which comes nearly a year after the startup announced its $66 million Series C, brings Aidoc's funding pot to $250 million. Aidoc offers tools that help radiologists find and triage injuries and health conditions based on imaging results. It also provides coordination software for stroke and cardiovascular care, alerting relevant members of the care team and sharing data and images.&nbsp;Aidoc said the Series D investment will fund the expansion of its AI Care Platform, which includes its identification and triage tools, as well as its care coordination software.
Recent studies published in the Lancet Digital Health raised some concerns about AI and imaging.</p>
