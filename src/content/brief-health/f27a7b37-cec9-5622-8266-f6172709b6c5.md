<p>Through architecture and design, it is possible to address this growing issue and implement solutions and processes that create a more productive and safe environment for healthcare workers and those they care for.
Healthcare designers must position the built environment to reduce stress, waste, and redundancy.
For instance, when designing patient rooms, it is imperative that the design solution aids in minimizing the time it takes healthcare workers to grab supplies or medical equipment from storage.
Nurses, for instance, spend a majority of their days with patients and designing a patient room for success will not only improve the quality of care, but it will also make work a lot less stressful for caregivers.
Increasing the number of touchless sanitizer stations found on the floor of a medical facility is also becoming increasingly important as it cuts down the time healthcare workers spend on handwashing and allows more immediate face-to-face communication with the patient.
By incorporating natural light, expansive views of the environment outside, and calming sounds, it is possible to bring the outdoors in to connect caregivers and patients with their surroundings.
To decrease employee burnout, healthcare designers can create areas for staff to take a moment of respite.
Respite rooms with recliners, dimmable lighting, and silence become one of the most important elements of healthcare design as it is the most appropriate environment for collecting oneself.</p>
