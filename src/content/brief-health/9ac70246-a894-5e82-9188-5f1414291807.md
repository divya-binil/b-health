---

When the novel coronavirus began its spread across the United States, it transformed healthcare in its entirety. That includes the health IT sector, where EHR vendors had to brainstorm and develop new EHR implementation ideas.

As a result, a number of remote, virtual EHR implementations launched, while another occurred at a pop-up hospital in the heart of New York City.

Meanwhile, in pre-pandemic days, wave of hospitals migrating away from certain revenue cycle products instigated large-scale EHR replacement projects. These stories represented some of the first transitions across EHR products wielding significant marketshare.

Although these are not all of the EHR implementations of 2020, these are some of the larger and most creative launches thatâ€™ll forever influence the industry. EHRIntelligence has listed these implementations in chronological order.
