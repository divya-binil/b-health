<p>In the face of <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/coronavirus-covid-19/">COVID-19</a>, healthcare witnessed how crises can become the long-awaited push for creativity and innovation that the industry needs. When our healthcare infrastructure’s weaknesses were exposed, <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/category/technology/telehealth-2/">telehealth </a>helped to stitch them up, with the number of telehealth claims <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-07-13/telehealth-continues-rapid-growth-amid-coronavirus-pandemic">increasing 8,336%</a> nationally from April 2019 to April 2020. Out of need, patients quickly turned to telehealth as a new model of care delivery; clinicians adapted to a new avenue for engaging with patients, policymakers began to improve incentives for its use; and home became our hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>As we continue the fight to control the virus in 2021, the industry is at a pivotal moment in ensuring this year’s telehealth momentum continues post-pandemic. Healthcare organizations should take time now to strategize how best to hardwire telehealth, so it is embedded into care delivery models long-term. In order to achieve this, leaders need to consider their collaboration with other stakeholders, longitudinal integration strategies that go beyond piecemeal solutions and transform the perception of what “home” means in healthcare to meet consumers where they are.&nbsp;</p>
