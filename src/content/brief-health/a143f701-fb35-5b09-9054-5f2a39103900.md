The digital health market is extremely volatile: start-ups show up, promise to disrupt the entire health scene, but go down just as fast having not received the necessary funding. Others change their profiles, partner with big pharma companies or lose the battle with another venture providing a better technology. Not to speak about the hype, buzzwords, and overmarketing, which calls for careful consideration. In spite of all the challenges, The Medical Futurist team is working tirelessly to stay ahead of the turbulent market changes and bring you the Top 100 Companies In Digital Health in an e-book every year.
