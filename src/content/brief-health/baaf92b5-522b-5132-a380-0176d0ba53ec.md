Analysing these recent developments can give us a better idea regarding where they are focusing the efforts, and how it might shape the future path of healthcare.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>But equally, if not more, strong players in this field are pharmaceutical giants, as their resources and influence can significantly shape or alter the course of this path.</strong> As such, we are kickstarting a new series of articles focusing on the digital health efforts of 14 global pharma companies. While those heavyweights are involved in a plethora of healthcare-related projects from vaccine development to clinical trials, we will specifically focus on digital health.</p><p>In the first article to the series, we will explore developments coming from pharma giants Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer, Bayer and Novartis.
