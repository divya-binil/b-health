<p>According to a recent study, COVID-19 has raised the expectations of patients when it comes to digital health. More patients than ever are willing to switch healthcare providers over a poor digital experience. Organizations that do not invest in getting rid of paper processes risk being left behind.</p><p><strong>Embracing Digital</strong></p><p>The pandemic has shown patients that paperless and contact-less healthcare is possible through telehealth, electronic communications and digital documents. According to a <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.01786"><i>Health Affairs</i> study</a> 30.1% of all visits were done via telehealth from January to June 2020 – 23 times higher than the rate of telehealth usage pre-pandemic.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.cedar.com/press/study-finds-40-uptick-consumers-who-have-switched-or-stopped-going-healthcare-provider-because-poor-digital-experience/">recent survey</a> also found that patients are now placing higher value on the overall digital experience they have with their healthcare provider:</p><ul><li>65% say that they would be very likely to recommend a healthcare provider or write them a good review if they offer a great digital experience</li><li>53% of consumers would consider switching doctors to get touchless paperwork and virtual care, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic</li><li>41% want digital forms and communication</li></ul><p>This trend towards a more digital healthcare experience is not new. For years we as consumers have seen digital improvements made in other industries like retail, banking, travel and even in our own workplaces that have resulted in easy, less frustrating interactions. There can be no doubt that we all want to see that same level of improvement in healthcare.</p>
