<p>The so-called SUNSET rule would have required the Department of Health and Human Services to review its regulations once a decade.<br><br>he U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a proposal this week to withdraw a final rule put forth by the Trump administration that would have required the agency to review its regulations once every ten years. &nbsp;</p><p>Members of the public have 60 days to submit comments on the proposal to withdraw the rule. &nbsp;</p><p>The Securing Updated and Necessary Statutory Evaluations Timely, or "SUNSET," rule had been scheduled to go into effect in March 2021 but was delayed following lawsuits. &nbsp;</p><p>"The SUNSET final rule, if implemented, would significantly alter the operations of HHS with considerable repercussions for a diverse array of stakeholders," said agency officials in a <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-23472.pdf">document published in the Federal Register</a> on Friday. &nbsp;</p>
