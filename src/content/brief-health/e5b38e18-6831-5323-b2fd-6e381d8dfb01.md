<p>Direct primary care provider Everside Health scooped up $164 million in growth equity funding.
"Limited access to quality primary care in the U.S. has compounded chronic conditions, exacerbated mental health problems and increased healthcare costs," Everside Health CEO Chris Miller said in a statement. The direct primary care company has made several acquisitions of its own.
Other players in the direct healthcare space include Nomi Health, which recently acquired sister companies Everyone Health and Sano Surgery, and Hint Health, which announced a $45 million raise in June.</p>
