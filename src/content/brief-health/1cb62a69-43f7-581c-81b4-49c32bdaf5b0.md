<p>Particle Health, a developer-friendly API platform for bi-directional healthcare data exchange, today announced the availability of Particle for EHRs. Particle for EHRs is a new administrative API layer that allows electronic health record (EHR) and platform service providers to easily access and send patient data to their customers by integrating Particle’s API suite. Using Particle for EHRs, EHR companies can connect their healthcare provider clients to the three largest nationwide health information networks - Carequality, CommonWell, and eHealth Exchange - with one platform-wide API integration.
EHR vendors using Particle for EHRs will obtain ADT feeds, access pharmacy data, and connect to upcoming Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs) without having to build across the TEFCA ecosystem.”
Their provider clients don’t need to sign additional contracts, as Particle for EHRs takes care of everything - including advanced record location services, network directory management, bidirectional data sharing APIs and processed, FHIR-native patient data.</p>
