<p>Jean Luc, founder and chief executive officer of HexTransforma Healthcare, spoke to Med-Tech Innovation about its emergence and entering the medtech and healthtech space.<br><br><strong>First of all, tell us about HexTransforma Healthcare – where did the idea come from?</strong></p><p>I broke my ankle whilst playing rugby back in 2017 and experienced first-hand the frustration caused by an overwhelmed, fragmented health system. The doctors responsible for my care&nbsp;informed me I’d have to wait at least six weeks to get a referral appointment to a specialist due to a lack of capacity in the system, which effectively prevented me from accessing the required services sooner and ultimately impacted my recovery. In these six weeks, I experienced ongoing swelling, tenderness, and pain and was left worried about the potential of delayed care causing more serious damage to my ankle. It was then that the innovation and desire behind HexTransforma’s remote monitoring solution was born, and eventually the company itself.</p>
