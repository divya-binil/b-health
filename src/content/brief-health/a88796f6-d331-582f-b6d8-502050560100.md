<p>Meet Eve Cunningham, MD MBA, the Chief of Virtual Care and Digital Health at Providence, and an active member of the HIMSS community. Cunningham has accomplished many things throughout her career, from developing her surgical skills as a gynecologist to incubating and launching a digital assistant product for providers that is now scaled across Providence.

She understands the strain and difficulties her team members have while attempting to juggle work and personal obligations as a leader. The incorporation of AI/ML technologies into clinical operations and the revolution of healthcare are Cunningham's future challenges.
