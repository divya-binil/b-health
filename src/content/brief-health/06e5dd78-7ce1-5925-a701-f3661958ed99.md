<p>Sixteen organizations launched a public education campaign to protect access to telehealth called Telehealth Access for America.</p><p>The members include the American Hospital Association (AHA), Johns Hopkins Medicine, Athenahealth, AARP and Ascension.&nbsp;</p><p>“Access to telehealth is vital to Americans’ well-being and quality of life,” AHA President and CEO Rick Pollack said in a <a href="https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2021-12-02-aha-others-launch-campaign-protect-access-telehealth-services"><strong>press release</strong></a>. “Without action from Congress, millions of Americans who have come to rely on telehealth services will lose access to the care they value.”&nbsp;</p><p>The initiative <a href="https://telehealthaccessforamerica.org/"><strong>advocates </strong></a>for telehealth because of its ability to promote better health outcomes, higher quality of life, health equity, patient empowerment and lower costs. (Earlier this year, though, <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/digital-health/out-pocket-costs-may-play-larger-role-telehealth-visits-than-person-care-survey"><strong>a study found</strong></a> that patients’ openness to telehealth slipped when presented with a potential cost increase.)&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, telehealth access is under threat as the temporary lift on the usual restrictions is set to end in January. The public health emergency order that allows for the exemption was already <a href="https://www.aota.org/Advocacy-Policy/Federal-Reg-Affairs/News/2020/HHS-Secretary-Renews-Public-Health-Emergency.aspx"><strong>renewed six times</strong></a> by the Department of Health and Human Services.&nbsp;</p>
