title: Female physicians spent 33 more minutes per day in EHRs
---

A research letter published this week found no difference in patient satisfaction scores despite the discrepancy in EHR time between male and female physicians.
A Journal of the American Medical Association research letter published this week found that female physicians tend to spend more time on all electronic health record metrics than their male counterparts.

In the study, researchers from the Duke University School of Medicine analyzed almost two years of outpatient EHR data, finding that female physicians spent an average of 33.4 more minutes in the EHR per day than their male counterparts â€“ equivalent to three additional 40-hour work weeks per year.

"Despite the increased EHR burden among female physicians, we found no difference in patient satisfaction scores by sex," wrote the researchers.
