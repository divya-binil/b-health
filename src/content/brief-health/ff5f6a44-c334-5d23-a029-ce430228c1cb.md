<p>On October 24, the Medical University of South Carolina health system (MUSC Health), based in Charleston, S.C., and the MetroHealth System (MetroHealth), based in Cleveland, announced a collaboration that would result in the creation of Ovatient, a nonprofit organisation providing virtual and in-home care. The organisation will concentrate on establishing and sustaining linkage to health systems and will provide them the chance to pool resources and handle difficulties with the healthcare staff. According to a press release about the announcement, "Health systems and their caregivers are best positioned to serve patients across a wide spectrum of health conditions, especially given their commitment to incorporating research and best practises into their clinical care. This is supported by numerous health outcomes data sources.&nbsp;</p>
