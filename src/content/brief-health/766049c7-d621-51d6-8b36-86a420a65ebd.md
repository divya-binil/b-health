<p>The American College of Cardiology (ACC) is planning a trio of studies that will measure whether personalized clinical guideline support delivered by an AI tool at the point of care can improve heart patients’ outcomes.</p><p>The TRANSFORM studies will each use HealthReveal’s software to generate and deliver care recommendations based on current best practices. These insights are surfaced to clinicians through the electronic health record (EHR) system and include medical literature informing the software’s recommendations.</p><p>The first of these tests will be the TRANSFORM HFrEF study. It will be led by Massachusetts General Hospital cardiology researcher Jim Januzzi, M.D., and focus on the treatment of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).</p><p>Effective strategies have already been established for treating the condition, said Januzzi, who is also a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a trustee of the ACC.</p>
