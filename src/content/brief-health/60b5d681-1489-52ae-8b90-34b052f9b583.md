<p>There have been over 47 million cases of COVID-19 globally and 1.2 million deaths. According to Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the treatment of patients with early COVID-19 infection requires urgent focus. Treating these patients early in the course of infection could help speed up their recovery and could also reduce the likelihood of severe outcomes. Early treatment would also reduce demand on healthcare systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Many COVID-19 patients experience mild symptoms early in infection but soon progress to severe disease that often leads to hospitalisation. Approximately 20% of symptomatic patients progress to severe or critical disease and suffer from pneumonia, ARDS, multiorgan dysfunction, hypercoagulation and hyperinflammatory manifestations. Some patients experience long recovery times and could also develop long-lasting fatigue, mental health issues and problems with their heart and lung function.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, there has been very little success with drugs that could potentially treat the infection at an early stage. Remdesivir has been found to be effective in reducing time to recovery in hospitalised patients, but it requires daily infusions for up to 10 days and is not suitable for treatment at the early stage of the disease. Similarly, dexamethasone reduces mortality in hospitalised patients requiring mechanical ventilation but has not been tested in early, mild disease. There is thus an urgent need for research in this direction to identify interventions that could be administered early on so that the disease would not progress and long-term complications could be avoided. These treatments should be safe and with few side effects, and should also be easy to administer.&nbsp;</p>
