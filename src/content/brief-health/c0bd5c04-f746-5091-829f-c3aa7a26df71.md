<p>Leveraging AI, machine learning and neural networks can help healthcare standardize data, comply with info blocking requirements and improve health outcomes. Healthcare is becoming more complex due to new regulations and standards, which Vignesh Shetty, senior vice president and general manager of Edison AI and Platform for GE Healthcare, believes artificial intelligence can help with (GEHC). Healthcare IT News questioned Shetty about the advancements made in the 360-patient perspective since his previous interview with us about the fascinating developments in data-driven insights and how algorithms handle difficult data exchanges. Both patients and doctors gain from incorporated artificial intelligence in anything from mobile x-ray equipment in the ER or ICU used to assess the lungs of COVID patients to MRI scanners used by doctors to detect cancers.</p>
