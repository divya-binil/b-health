<p>In 2020, we all suffered a blow. No matter where you live or what industry you work in, you got hit by the pandemic. Out of nowhere, our everyday lives have significantly changed. Most of us tried to pull it together and find out how to move forward; and ultimately it turned out that the only reliable answer to this global challenge for all of us is <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/the-unlikely-rise-of-science-and-digital-health-during-covid-19">science</a>.</p><p>Long before the summer, I <a href="https://youtu.be/lvPjeJbk9V4">outlined 3 scenarios</a> in a video that based on the data and trends I see, there will definitely be approved vaccines by Q1 of 2021, maybe even before. <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/tracking-covid-19-vaccinations">Vaccine production</a> and development are since ongoing and as transparent as can be – and to whoever questions the speed of the development and argues that it poses threats to the vaccine’s efficacy, I can give a simple answer. For you must know that there were <strong>no corners cut</strong> in the clinical trials and approval processes. These are up to all the standards and deemed safe by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/test-approve.html">separate</a>, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines">independent</a> regulatory <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca">bodies</a>. The studies were published in <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">high-level</a>, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1/fulltext">international</a>, peer-reviewed <a href="https://www.bmj.com/coronavirus">medical journals</a>.</p>
