<p>Advata, an advanced analytics software company, announces the promotions of Corinne Stroum and Jamie Snell as the two newest members of the company's leadership team.
With more than four decades of collective experience in the industry, Stroum and Snell will continue to support Advata in greater capacities as the company pursues the transformation of healthcare management and operations through technology.
Corinne Stroum (left) and Jamie Snell have been selected to serve as the Senior Vice President, Head of Product, and Chief Customer Success Officer, respectively. Prior to Advata, Snell served KenSci as Vice President of Operations and Engineering, dedicated to building out the organization's first integration platform that helped healthcare organizations and providers consume real-time data into a common analytics model.
Although the company just launched in June, Advata is already planning to continue expanding several departments to address ongoing challenges faced throughout the healthcare industry and provide advanced data analytics, transforming healthcare management and operations by reducing costs, optimizing patient care, and increasing team efficiency.</p>
