<p>The rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence in healthcare has changed the sector. Additionally, a number of AI algorithms have invaded the lives of the general public as a result of the recent emergence of programmes like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and comparable ones. The way medicine is practiced will surely change as a result of these innovations. It is impossible to overestimate the value of competent regulation in the healthcare sector, where decisions can literally mean life or death. Now, even the most seasoned specialists would find this to be a very difficult task. AI and ML provide further regulatory difficulties. These technologies can develop and learn over time, in contrast to conventional medical devices. This implies that they might behave differently than they did in the real world.</p>
