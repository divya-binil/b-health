<p>The MITIEverseTM, a new app committed to health care education, training, and innovation, offers hands-on practise, remote guidance from expert doctors, and more to medical and scientific learners. The software, created in collaboration with FundamentalVR, takes users into specialised showcase rooms, surgical simulations, and lectures from Houston Methodist faculty and international collaborators.
