<p>Healthcare Innovation recently spoke with lead author of the “Original Investigation” in JAMA Health Forum, entitled “Trends in Ransomware Attacks on US Hospitals, Clinics, and Other Health Care Delivery Organizations, 2016-2021”. The lead author of a "Original Investigation" in JAMA Health Forum titled "Trends in Ransomware Attacks on US Hospitals, Clinics, and Other Health Care Delivery Organizations, 2016-2021," Hannah T. Neprash, Ph.D., assistant professor, Division of Health Policy and Management, University of Minnesota School of Public Health, was interviewed by Healthcare Innovation. On this page, we discussed the study. She gave her thoughts on the alarming findings as well as her predictions for what lies ahead for healthcare cybersecurity. Cybercrime is concerning because healthcare workers must be able to attend to patients when they require care for it to function.</p>
