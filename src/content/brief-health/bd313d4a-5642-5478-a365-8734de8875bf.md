<p>The EU has approved an artificial intelligence (AI) technology that can identify people at risk of a fatal heart attack, years before it strikes.</p><p>The CaRi-Heart technology, developed by British Heart Foundation (BFH) spinout company <a href="https://www.caristo.com/">Caristo Diagnostics</a>, utilises coronary CT angiogram (CTTA) scans already performed in clinical practice.&nbsp;</p><p>It uses AI and deep-learning technology to produce a fat attenuation index score (FAI-Score), which accurately measures inflammation of blood vessels in and around the heart.</p><p>A BHF-funded study involving around 4,000 patients found those with an abnormal FAI were up to nine times more likely to die of a heart attack in the next nine years than those with normal FAI readings.&nbsp;</p><p>It also found that around one third of patients initially considered low risk after a routine CCTA, had a much higher risk after CaRi-Heart was applied to their scan.&nbsp;</p>
