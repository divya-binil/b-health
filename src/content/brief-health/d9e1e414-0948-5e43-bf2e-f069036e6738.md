<p>By utilizing OpenAI services on Microsoft Azure, UNC Health team members may instantly get references that reduce their administrative duties without having to waste time scouring training libraries. UNC Health will start deploying its internal chatbot tool to a select set of physicians and administrators as part of Epic's generative artificial intelligence programme, which uses Microsoft Azure. Later this year, UNC Health intends to make the tool more widely available.</p><p>A chat bot that functions like Chat GPT in a controlled, safe corporate environment is the first AI-powered software that the Chapel Hill, North Carolina-based health system has revealed. Brent Lamm, UNC Health's chief information officer, said: "By using this technology carefully and safely, we believe we can help improve the way healthcare is provided throughout North Carolina and across the country."</p>
