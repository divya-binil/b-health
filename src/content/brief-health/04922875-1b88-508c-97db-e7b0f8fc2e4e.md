<p>In 2019, leveraging the momentum of their patient digital experience transformation, NYU Langone established an organization-wide strategy to transform the clinician's digital experience.
Dr. Paul Testa, chief medical information officer at NYU Langone Health, said the digital transformation has been successful due in large part to the fact that all of their decisions are grounded in metrics and measurements.
"This was an integral part of our digital strategy and is what has allowed us to see the impact our products have had on our clinicians and patients," he said.
Testa will address strategies for a successful IT transformation in a session titled "Driving Clinician Digital Experience with IT Transformation" scheduled for this Tuesday, March 15, from 4:15-5:15 pm in room W208C.</p>
