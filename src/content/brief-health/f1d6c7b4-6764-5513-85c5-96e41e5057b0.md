<p><br>Exciting changes have been proposed by the Office of the National Coordinator of Health IT (ONC) and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) that remove "information blocking" and increase patient access to medical information.</p><p>As a 21-year-old patient, I am often frustrated by the healthcare system that still uses archaic technology. These proposed rules, if they are passed, require that health information technology, such as electronic medical records (EMRs), and the doctors who use them would have to share medical information with patients using modern technology and to share it with patients on the apps that they choose. There are many reasons that patients need access to their medical records.</p>
