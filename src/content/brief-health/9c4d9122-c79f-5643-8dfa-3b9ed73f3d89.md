<p>A few years ago we <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/9-exciting-medical-robot-facts/">wrote about Veebot</a> when we collected the most exciting tasks robots could do in hospitals. Veebot created a robot that could draw blood – in difficult cases faster and even more effectively than a human. Tests showed that it can correctly identify the most accessible vein with an 83% accuracy. This is about as good as an experienced human phlebotomist.&nbsp;Moreover, with this technology, the blood-drawing process takes only about a minute.</p><p>Veebot’s <a href="https://youtu.be/s30FPobi9iA">video</a> was hugely popular because they wanted to robotise a process known to and disliked by everyone. It turned out that everyone wanted the result this robot could achieve – but without the robot itself.</p>
