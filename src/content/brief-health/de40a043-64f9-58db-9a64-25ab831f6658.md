<p>The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has chosen Riverain Technologies, the creator of Clear Visual IntelligenceTM (CVITM) for chest imaging interpretation, to supply its distinctive imaging interpretation solution, ClearReadTM CT, to the Veteran Affairs' (VA) Lung Precision Oncology Program (LPOP). With ClearRead CT, chest imaging interpretation for LPOP patients at the VA will now also include CVI with vascular suppression in addition to standard CT pictures. ClearRead CT with CVI has demonstrated a 29% reduction in missed nodules and a 26% reduction in nodule search time, improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling earlier intervention for better patient outcomes. With an estimated 900,000 veterans at risk for lung cancer due to age, smoking, and other factors, the VA diagnoses and treats around 8,000 veterans with lung cancer each year.</p>
