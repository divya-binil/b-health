<p>The Cedars-Sinai Accelerator is welcoming 10 health-tech startup companies from around the world to its eighth accelerator class.
The companies are building a variety of healthcare solutions-from culturally-appropriate digital mental health services to wearable devices that help patients manage chronic asthma.
“Promising new technologies and advances in the digital space can drive positive change in how healthcare is experienced," said James Laur, JD, vice president of Intellectual Property and managing director of Cedars-Sinai Technology Ventures, and one of the founders of the accelerator.
“Our accelerator provides that vital partnership to early-stage companies that are developing solutions that health systems need to provide high-quality, safe and efficient care for patients.”
With the device, the company’s goal is to empower patients to manage their condition, optimizing the affordability of healthcare and hospital resources.
Aidin-Aidin has created a digital healthcare workflow platform that helps to streamline and structure hospital workflows, helping case managers accomplish daily tasks faster and transition patients to trusted care providers.
The company aims to help reduce patients’ length of stay, manage staff assignments and address delays in real time.</p>
