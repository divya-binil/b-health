<p>In the investment world, trends are critical weathervanes. They help determine which way the winds are blowing. In the digital health market, new trends reveal future opportunities for innovators and shape healthcare investors’ strategies for venture capital companies.</p><p>In 2020, digital health ventures saw a year like no other. Driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, funding rose by a remarkable <a href="https://rockhealth.com/reports/2020-market-insights-report-chasing-a-new-equilibrium/">72% from a record-high set in 2018</a>, amounting to $14 billion invested across 440 deals. Telemedicine alone shattered funding records with <a href="https://mercomcapital.com/venture-funding-digital-health-sector-2020/">$4.3 billion in 2020</a>. Total funding for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/healthcare-trends-q4-2020/">digital health hit an all-time high of $26.5 billion</a>. 2021 may well achieve another all-time record.</p><p>It’s been a season in healthcare that will surely have long-lasting effects. With the dramatic acceleration of telehealth and its potential use beyond anything we’ve seen in the past,&nbsp;it is now estimated that <strong>up to </strong><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality">$250 billion of current total U.S. healthcare spend</a><strong> could be virtualized</strong>. While this shift is not inevitable, it will require improvements in information exchange, and broader access and integration of technology.&nbsp;</p>
