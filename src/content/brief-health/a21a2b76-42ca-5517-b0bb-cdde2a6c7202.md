Agencies that would see a boost in cybersecurity-related funding under the proposed budget for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1 include the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, as well as the Food and Drug Administration.

But two Department of Health and Human Services' units that regulate health IT security and privacy matters - the Office for Civil Rights and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT - would see their budgets cut under the president's budget.

The president's budget is little more than a wish list because Congress must enact appropriations, and the final funding levels often differ substantially from the administration's budget requests.
