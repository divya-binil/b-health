<p>At its second attempt, Novartis has won FDA approval for its cholesterol lowering drug inclisiran, which can reduce levels with just two injections a year.
The FDA has approved the drug under the Leqvio trade name as an adjunct to maximum-dose statin drugs for people who need further LDL-cholesterol reduction to reach targets, a year after it was given a green light in Europe.
Novartis is also running clinical trials to show that the reduction in LDL-cholesterol is accompanied by reduced cardiovascular outcomes â€“ data that both Repatha and Praluent already have in hand.</p>
