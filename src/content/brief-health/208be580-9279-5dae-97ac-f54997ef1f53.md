<p><strong>For long, Microsoft and Apple have fiercely battled it out in the home computer space. And while they are still competitors in that field, their competition has extended to the healthcare field. However, their approach (and success) significantly differ.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Like while Apple was turning its Apple Watch <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/tech-giants-in-healthcare-2021/">into a point-of-care device</a>, Microsoft seemed more focused on the enterprise side of things rather than the consumer side. Throughout 2020, the company <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/microsoft-extends-reach-into-healthcare-13-things-to-know.html">strengthened its healthcare-related partnerships</a> with healthcare organisations and research institutes.</p><p>Its recent moves indicate as much. Gregg Pessin, an analyst with Gartner, speculated at what those moves could mean. “<i>You’ve got a lot of companies that are producing a lot of devices and hospitals to want that data – think about an Apple Watch and its competitors, blood pressure cuffs, weight scales, pulse oximeters and glucometers for diabetic patients</i>,” Gregg Pessin <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-has-big-plans-for-healthcare-and-its-taking-a-different-path-to-the-rest-of-big-tech/">told ZDNet in a recent interview</a>. “<i>That data needs to be accessible to the GPs of the world, and it’s difficult for them to get access to that. I think that Microsoft is attempting to figure out a way to make that easier. I don’t think they’re quite there yet, but I think there is a huge opportunity there.</i>“</p><p><strong>So we took a look at how Microsoft plans to better organise health data. In our series peeking into the healthcare developments around tech giants, we already looked at </strong><a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/amazons-march-into-healthcare-a-2021-update"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/googles-masterplan-for-healthcare"><strong>Google</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/apple-in-healthcare-2021"><strong>Apple</strong></a><strong>. Now it’s time for technology heavyweight-champion, Microsoft.</strong></p>
