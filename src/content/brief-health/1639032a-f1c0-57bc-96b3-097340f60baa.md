Practically, he wanted to know how I think those hardware should be upgraded to make it ready for A.I.</p><p>To answer him, I made a seemingly unrelated analogy coming from the video game industry: cloud gaming. This approach, where the cloud handles all the processing power, has gained traction lately; bypassing the need for powerful PCs and consoles altogether. <strong>What if the same fate awaits medical professionals and hospitals with limited IT infrastructure that still want to benefit from power-hungry technologies like A.I.?</strong></p>
