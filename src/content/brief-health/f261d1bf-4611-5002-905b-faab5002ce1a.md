      AMC Health was formed to strengthen the connection between caregivers and
      patients. We do it by being your single source for clinical services and
      monitoring technology that expand care beyond the walls of hospitals and
      clinics. Everything you need to turn remote medicine into impactful
      patient and provider solutions AMC Health delivers it.


      Our exceptional technology and Bluetooth® peripherals work to deepen the
      clinician/patient bond by allowing care to continue between in-person
      visits. From the comfort of home, patients’ biometric and behavioral data
      is collected and compiled, so it can be accessed in near real-time by care
      providers. Telehealth visits provide face-to-face interactions anytime,
      anywhere, in the most cost-efficient and convenient manner possible.


      At AMC Health, we take healthcare from an inconsistent, episodic model to
      a proactive, real-time delivery approach that increases effectiveness,
      maximizes time and dollars, promotes patient involvement, and leads to
      better outcomes.

<p>AMC Health, the leading provider in telehealth and remote patient monitoring (RPM) technology, today announced that its expanded and longstanding relationship with eviCore healthcare (eviCore) will include new interactive voice response (IVR) solutions designed to help assess, monitor, and triage support for patients who are living with underlying conditions and at the greatest risk of Coronavirus (COVID-19) and respiratory symptoms. In addition to AMC’s ongoing telehealth services for hospitals, health plans, and veterans, launching and expanding these solutions will proactively ensure that high-risk patients can be monitored at-home.</p><p>With the immediate focus on reducing the spread of COVID-19 also comes the need for better care at home, along with contingency planning to manage capacity issues and premature discharges implemented to free-up ICU beds in hospitals.</p><p>“AMC Health is working together with eviCore to provide their client partners with IVR capabilities that include IVR surveys for their health plan patient populations with symptom-based questions and educational content. This will help assess patients and reduce the strain on hospitals and health teams to better manage the surge of emergency-room and capacity strains as COVID-19 continues to rapidly escalate,” said Nesim Bildirici, CEO of AMC Health.</p><p>AMC Health’s telehealth IVR solutions are deployed quickly and at scale for those living with chronic conditions and underlying conditions. As millions are sheltering at home, AMC and eviCore are providing a menu of COVID-19 solutions to help patients stay connected to their providers and nurses.</p><p>“Working together is how we will win this war on COVID-19. AMC’s IVR-only solutions help us to easily and effectively work with their patient population to assess those at-risk of COVID-19 while they are quarantined and chronically ill. And, should the need arise where more comprehensive RPM services are needed with at-home peripherals devices, it’s great to know that AMC is ready to go,” said Corrine McKeever, RN, BSN, Senior Director, Clinical Operations with eviCore healthcare.</p><p><br><strong>About AMC Health</strong></p><p>AMC’s <strong>passion</strong> drives their <strong>purpose</strong> to give everyone the <strong>power</strong> to live healthier, more independent, lives in their comfort of their own home.
