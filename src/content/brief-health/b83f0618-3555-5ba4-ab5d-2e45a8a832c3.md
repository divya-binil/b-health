The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths around the globe. An important thing to note is that more men have died from COVID-19 than women. A European study shows that men had a slightly higher incidence of COVID-19 with no respiratory distress compared to women. Still, more males with COVID-19 developed severe respiratory failure compared to females. Other studies also show that men are more likely to die from the SARS-CoV-2 infection than women, and this is true across all age groups under 90 years. The same pattern was observed during the SARS outbreak, where men had a higher case fatality rate than women.Â
