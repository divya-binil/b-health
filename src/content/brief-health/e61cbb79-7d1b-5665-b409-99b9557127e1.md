<p>Artificial intelligence in cardiology tools can help ensure timely, accurate diagnosis for the early initiation of key life saving therapies.<br><br>Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial to enable early initiation o`f key life saving therapies and to reduce hospitalizations.</p><p>Us2.ai is automating the fight against heart disease by using artificial intelligence (AI) software to simplify and democratize ultrasound of the heart â€“ the most commonly used tool for the detection of cardiovascular risk. The founders, Carolyn Lam and James Hare, share their insights on why delivering high-value solutions will transform healthcare.</p><h2><strong>Turning on the lights: A better understanding of our own heart health&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><strong>HT: </strong><i>What unmet medical need did you set out to address with your start-up?</i></p><p><strong>Us2.ai: </strong>Heart failure (HF) is a global public health problem, <strong>affecting&nbsp;over 64 million people worldwide.</strong>1 The cost worldwide is estimated at <strong>$108 billion per year</strong> with a large bulk of the costs due to hospitalization.2 Despite advances in management, HF remains as malignant as some common cancers3&nbsp;and survival post-diagnosis is only around 50% at 5 years.4&nbsp;</p>
