<p>Lumeon, a pioneer in care orchestration technology, and NTT DATA, a world-renowned provider of digital business and IT services, today announced a strategic partnership to coordinate the provision of important non-clinical services for hospital-at-home programmes, such as patient meals, medications, housekeeping services, and home setup. Clinicians have been charged with organising many of the non-clinical services needed by patients when healthcare systems start to test hospital-at-home services, which is unsustainable and prohibitively expensive as the programmes expand. By automating this coordination, NTT DATA's virtual command centre technology, which is based on the Lumeon care orchestration engine, will give clinicians more time to focus on patient care and make it more affordable to provide the right care.</p>
