<p>Judging by the success of digital channels in maintaining contact with patients and enabling clinicians to collaborate during the pandemic, together with the importance of data in optimizing resource allocation, it is not surprising that healthcare leaders specializing in health informatics are convinced that data has the power to transform the future of healthcare.
One of the challenges informatics healthcare leaders are addressing through better use of data is the current shortage and high burn-out rate of clinicians.
A plurality of informatics leaders cited improvements in data security and privacy protocols as the top prerequisite to increasing institutional trust in predictive analytics.
The good news is the majority of informatics healthcare leaders surveyed appear to have confidence in the data available to them, with nearly three quarters (74%) reporting they can already extract actionable insights from it.
As informatics healthcare leaders look to effectively use data in their organizations, they report working with other hospitals and healthcare facilities (38%) or with health technology companies (33%) as the partnerships are likely to hold the most promise.
That puts them firmly in line with the global average for all healthcare leaders surveyed in the Future Health Index 2022 Report.</p>
