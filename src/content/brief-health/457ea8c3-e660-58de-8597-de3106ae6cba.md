<p>CONFERENCE ON ORACLE CERNER HEALTH - Virtual Nursing Station was developed specifically for nursing workflows by Wellsheet Inc., the leading provider of Smart EHR UI that decreases physician burnout and improves Electronic Health Record (EHR) efficiency and usability. This innovation aims to improve patient care, staff productivity, and job satisfaction. High levels of clinician burnout and employee turnover have led to an unsustainable nursing shortage, which is having an effect on patient care and is reflected in the financial losses recorded by health systems, which can't cut their way to profitability or better care. In order to reduce expenses and increase efficiency, they must invest in technology, according to Wellsheet's CEO and creator, Craig Limoli. For nurses, care managers, and providers, Virtual Nursing Station is a cross-functional team collaborative care solution.</p>
