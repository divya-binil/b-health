<p>After years of struggling with nurse recruitment and retention, some believe the nursing shortage in 2023 may turn a corner. Front-line nurses are aware that their workplaces are suffering as a result of the nursing shortage without the need for statistics. Despite this, the data do convincingly demonstrate that it is past time to start making adjustments. And in 2023, a hospital's ability to attract and keep skilled nurses may be the most important area of concentration. The cost of the nursing shortage in terms of money is crystal evident. According to the Nurse.com 2022 Nurse Salary Research Report, 29% of the 2,516 nurses polled were considering quitting nursing altogether. You're not alone if you're thinking of switching workplaces. The two main factors for the 28% of nurses who left were management and pay.&nbsp;</p><p>There are several steps that could be taken to address the nursing shortage in the US in 2023:</p><ul><li>Increase funding for nursing education programs: This could include increasing funding for nursing schools, providing scholarships and grants for nursing students, and offering loan forgiveness programs for nurses who work in underserved areas.</li><li>Offer incentives to attract more people to the nursing profession: This could include increasing salaries and benefits for nurses, providing opportunities for professional development, and offering flexible scheduling options.</li><li>Promote the nursing profession: This could include highlighting the important role that nurses play in healthcare, and the many opportunities for advancement within the field.</li><li>Increase the number of nursing school faculty: There is currently a shortage of nursing school faculty, which has led to a decrease in the number of nursing students being accepted into programs. Increasing the number of faculty members could help to address this issue.</li><li>Implement policies that support nurses: This could include improving working conditions and providing support for continuing education and professional development.</li><li>Address the high rates of nurse burnout: Burnout is a major issue in the nursing profession, and it can lead to nurses leaving the field. Implementing policies that support mental health and well-being could help to address this issue.</li></ul>
