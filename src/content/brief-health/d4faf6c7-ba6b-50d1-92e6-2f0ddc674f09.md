<p>Sara Vaezy, executive vice president and chief digital officer of Renton, Wash.-based Providence, told <i>Becker's </i>that health systems can learn from giants such as Starbucks and Amazon about personalizing patients' experiences with their healthcare organizations, and one way Providence is doing this is by creating identity-driven engagement to tailor its services to individual consumers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Question: You posed the question: What can healthcare learn from Starbucks? Can you tell me more about that?</strong></p><p><strong>Sara Vaezy: </strong>Companies like Starbucks and Amazon have done really well at connecting buyers and sellers. In our case, it's connecting the clinician and the patient, or the system to the consumer with things such as content, information, tools and services.</p><p>Patients are going to be online and they are interested in various different channels. We need to personalize and tailor our reach to consumers and meet them where they are, just like Starbucks does with its mobile application and rewards programs.&nbsp;<br><a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/digital-health/what-health-systems-can-learn-from-starbucks-on-patient-engagement-q-a-with-providences-sara-vaezy.html">Read on beckershospitalreview.com</a></p>
