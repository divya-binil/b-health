<p>Recently, our colleagues at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) saw an opportunity to leverage USCDI+ and we have now launched a new USCDI+ collaboration to support HRSA’s Uniform Data System (UDS) reporting through the UDS Modernization Initiative. ONC and HRSA are working together to align the UDS with interoperability standards and transition to patient-level reporting requirements with USCDI and other quality reporting efforts.
Recently, HRSA launched its UDS Modernization Initiative to expand and improve the UDS data set, aligning with health information technology (IT) advancements, such as FHIR.</p>
