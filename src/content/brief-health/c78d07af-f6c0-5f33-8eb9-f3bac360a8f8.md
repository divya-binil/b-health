<p>With the RPG Group's acquisition of the senior-focused digital care platform Seniority, HCAH, an Indian health tech business in the out-of-hospital care sector, is moving into elderly care. One of the biggest senior care platforms in India, Seniority offers more than 20,000 senior-friendly medical and lifestyle items. In order to meet unmet expectations from the elderly care industry, HCAH purchased the platform to increase its visibility and clientele. According to CEO and co-founder Vivek Srivastava, "by acquiring Seniority, our objective is to cater to all the demands and provide a one-stop shop to our rapidly expanding elderly population." The aged make up around 60% of HCAH's current clientele, and they are served by its rehabilitation, ICU, nursing, caregiver, consulting, lab, and other services.</p>
