<p>Throughout the last year and a half, healthcare chief information officers (CIOs) have had to continuously and rapidly innovate in a number of ways to meet the twists and turns of the pandemic. Now, although the darkest days of the crisis are behind us, clinical IT leaders are feeling intense pressure to not only unify care coordination, but also optimize digital health expansion amid the COVID-19 financial aftermath, <a href="https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/clinical-it/digital-health-innovation/news/21223849/patient-engagement-generating-value-from-it-systems-topofmind-for-cios">according to a recent survey</a> conducted by health IT consulting firm Stoltenberg Consulting Inc.</p><p>Stoltenberg, which cohosted the 2021 survey with the College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME), also noted in their report, “Health systems that fail to deliver on the digital experience could struggle to attract new consumers following the pandemic. The potential impact: loss of competitive position and difficulty regaining financial health.”</p><p>What’s more, just 14 percent of CIOs in this survey said AI is their top area of focus, which signified a major drop from the previous two years’ iterations of the report; in 2020, nearly 43 percent of CIO respondents chose AI/machine learning as their top priority.</p><p>To discuss the changing priorities amidst the pandemic, how his health system is investing in AI, and the challenge of meeting evolving consumer demands, <i>Healthcare Innovation </i>recently spoke with Scott Arnold, executive vice president and CIO at Tampa General Hospital (TGH), who has been in an executive leadership role at the organization for over a decade. Below are excerpts of that discussion.</p>
