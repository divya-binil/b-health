<p>As the <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/coronavirus-covid-19/">COVID-19 pandemic </a>has gripped the world, many providers have adopted an all-hands-on-deck approach and mentality for treating COVID-19 patients, stretching their resources to the breaking point.&nbsp;</p><p>We have heard about the frontline heroes who have sacrificed their own health and safety to treat patients and, in less-fortunate scenarios, comfort patients in their last moments as they were quarantined from loved ones.&nbsp;</p><p>What has been less recognized is the work and sacrifice put forth by providers’ back-office staff. Many back-office workers have had to transform their operational practices after shifting to “work-from-home” mode to avoid potential exposure and minimize traffic to hospitals and physicians’ offices.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to working in new environments, some of these back-office administrators who help process claims, receive reimbursements, check eligibility and manage denials are also seeing a higher volume of claims that are more complicated in nature due to the severity and complexity of managing COVID-19 symptoms in patients. Others are working with bare-bones staff as elective procedure volumes have decreased.&nbsp;</p>
