<p>Although ChatGPT and Bard cannot give users trustworthy medical or therapeutic recommendations, it is uncertain whether these chatbots can help patients choose the best doctor or facility. Surprisingly, both chatbots occasionally recommend particular doctors and hospitals while offering thorough provider details. It is challenging to evaluate the quality and value of this information, though. Chatbots like Microsoft and OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard combine truth with "truthiness," a phrase created by comedian Stephen Colbert to characterize information that feels real but lacks supporting data. I discussed this in a recent Forbes.com essay. For instance, Bard confidently gave me data on the quantity of knee replacement operations performed by significant Chicago hospitals in 2021, as well as those facilities' infection rates and the country's average.</p>
