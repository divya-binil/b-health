<p>Healthcare businesses throughout the world are dealing with a plethora of issues, such as a lack of qualified staff members and employee discontent. They must priorities the incorporation of evidence-based practice into clinical workflows in order to improve patient care.</p><p>Evidence-based practice (EBP), according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is an interdisciplinary approach to clinical decision-making that takes into account the best available evidence, the context of patient care, and the preferences of healthcare professionals. EBP has developed over time to incorporate the greatest available research findings, clinical know-how, patient values, and the environment of the particular healthcare institution. By reducing errors, enhancing safety, increasing care efficiency, and reducing costs, the growing adoption of EBP in healthcare is essential to ensuring that patients receive high-quality treatment. The availability of evidence-based recommendations also gives clinicians peace of mind by enabling them to compare their methods.</p>
