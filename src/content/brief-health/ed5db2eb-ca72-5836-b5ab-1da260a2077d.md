<p>The numerous health care issues brought on by the physician shortage in the United States are frequently addressed using telehealth, also known as telemedicine. For those who might not otherwise have access to doctors due to factors including a lack of nearby doctors in their rural region, mobility problems, or a lack of transportation, virtual care enables access. However, it is deceptive to believe that telemedicine is a cure-all for everything wrong with the healthcare system. The main issue, that there are not enough doctors to meet the demand for telemedicine, is not resolved by telehealth. Primary care doctors are frequently a patient's first port of call when they become ill since they assist people in maintaining health and preventing disease. Expected shortfalls in the United States range from 17,800 to 48,000.</p>
