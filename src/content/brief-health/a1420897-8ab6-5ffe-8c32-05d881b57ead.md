title: The surprising role of the Internet of Things in addressing clinician shortages
---

The clinician shortage is a dilemma for most hospitals today. It’s projected that the size of the RN workforce will be nearly 20% below projected requirements by 2020 and the physician shortfall will rise to nearly 122,000 by 2032. These shortages have a far-reaching ripple effect. They can lead to burnout, low morale and high turnover, all of which have a negative impact on patient satisfaction and care.

Labor is a hospital’s biggest expense. It’s a cost that shortages are making worse as hospitals increase pay, offer bonuses and boost benefits to attract and retain talent. The negative impact this has on financial stability and profit margins is evident and relief isn’t expected for years to come.
