<p>OneStep, a first-of-its-kind physical therapy app that leverages smartphone sensors to provide lab-level analysis, today announced the launch of its fall risk detection capabilities.
“Previously, gait speed was one of the only factors assessed to determine if someone was a fall risk, but OneStep enables a multifactorial assessment with gait variability to make a more accurate determination of risk – and data collection is more accurate since a person's movement is assessed in real-life, over time, not just in a clinic or lab.”
Using OneStep, providers that are alerted of a trend that may indicate increased probability of falls, can take immediate action to correct gait impairments, provide assistive devices and implement fall safety education before a medical event occurs. These parameters are part of ongoing research efforts to study their correlation with actual falls, which are tracked by OneStep’s physical therapists and provider partners, and to create state-of-the-art, data-driven tools to assess fall risk even more accurately in the future.</p>
