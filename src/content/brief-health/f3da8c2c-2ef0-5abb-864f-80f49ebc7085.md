<p><strong>Louise Parberry, senior sales engineer at InterSystems, explores why interoperability could be key when it comes to unlocking the success of healthcare startups.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Startups are behind some of the most innovative software applications and solutions being developed for the healthcare industry today.

Therefore, as healthcare startups develop new applications, they must do so in accordance with interoperability standards.</p>
