Innovaccer also received the highest customer satisfaction overall, with 85% of customers reporting they were "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with Innovaccer's Data Activation Platform.</p><p>"2022 is the year of the data platform, and we're thrilled to be ranked No. 1 in this new category," said Abhinav Shashank, co-founder and CEO of Innovaccer. "People are starting to realize that they need a data platform to drive digital transformation. The big winners in healthcare are going to be the organizations that understand their data well and can drive transformation by unlocking the value of their data. And to do that, a data platform is essential because it makes it possible to electrify your data assets and drive rapid innovation. KLAS creating a Data &amp; Analytics Platform category is a clear recognition of that."</p><p>Innovaccer's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_trXdvyuHYLgP0iT22SJZ9tJi5QxJhR_xAXWjYOaFHo8hMWSJ--sowQ99Fai3fo0Mr8uEamp52ubUR_j6r67u35xQ0m5OGEmez-7tG_w63ttyC5rgKAYR8CK639fBDO78A8qknKyYPi9SIHpgAtSFerHb39M9XwZMzy6hnCocW1ZItXPuXl3_urkvO-xF2u8Q8cIps8Qki7H37IEi2JM_YR8crbVp7-rToN1-FM8rOQ=">Data Activation Platform</a> offers a fresh approach to driving whole-person care. It breaks down data silos by unifying healthcare data into a single, longitudinal patient record in an open yet secure cloud data platform. In this unified data model, all healthcare data sources—including clinical, claims, labs, pharmacy, and even external third-party data sources such as social determinants of health (SDoH)—are cleaned, standardized, and integrated. The developer-friendly data platform supports FHIR standards for healthcare data interoperability and has the ability to write custom analytics models that can work across the platform and applications.</p><p>A Best in KLAS Award recognizes software and services companies that excel in helping healthcare professionals improve patient care.

"They have recognized something that a lot of companies are trying to do, which is to bring together messy [healthcare] data and unify it. Even when we are starting to get into FHIR and things like that, there is a cafeteria of different data types and sources. Some of the formats are messy, and some are clear. Innovaccer has really built their capabilities, not just their technology, to ingest and integrate data. They [allow] their customers to take their own direction and bring in their own upstream data sources. We need to be able to be pointed toward necessary data sources, even if another vendor has a weird connectivity mechanism."</p><p>Being recognized by KLAS Research as a Best in KLAS vendor and a leader in any category—let alone a new category, such as Data&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp; Analytics&nbsp;Platform—is one of the highest honors a vendor can receive. It validates the success of a vendor's technology and its contributions to the healthcare industry.&nbsp;The mission of the annual KLAS assessment is to help providers and payers evaluate best-in-market technologies. It&nbsp;determines its rankings from a combination of in-depth interviews and data points captured over a period of 12 months through a process of customer interviews.&nbsp;Its transparent and impartial insights provide an unbiased view of market solutions and how they provide value.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=pbPRxKVjRY1AFBscmPaUTjdEEDS6bxE7P4BP4gV1ffkgSMde6gLGo6AUqBOCDTkOlZ__PcZuerLeKD74oPCZK4GLKZh6-AYiGC2KfR2UfXiReH61VADWAgJB-DKBIzr-687s95hBFJXygicJ6goMQuENZwQe6hbTNRdx0hVEP_v-yQ5OA-bQV7m2HTCbhK3GlME5_vq68djn-EMc5c_XrVZC9ZQ_DtHR8YnP-OSrDLeR6pL9JWmIltd4TNkpwxfHbMr4p3lvUZA-S9U2EUyvT0R3VVihmsj59Z2NIhzuFvQN5PI3yzMEPG9Jr5ctpRdGtLrIrKHeBBPuRjSTAwY2otWcQiE_P_eMIO7dD1A1dlAp1_SBEJwLFmEwtjfjB8qX">2022 KLAS Data &amp; Analytics Platform report</a> is available now to KLAS subscribers.
