<p>The improved analytics are helping the post-acute healthcare organization's members find new patients, expand into new markets and meet their business goals. The vast post-acute healthcare service business VGM &amp; Associates provides support to thousands of different providers of various sorts, from small independent practises to significant regional and national chains. When asked to provide them with more precise business intelligence, VGM was aware that each member's needs were very varied. Helping members understand their markets better and work more effectively in them is necessary if they are to locate and cure more patients. "We're always looking to provide a higher level of market intelligence and enable our members to help them do business more efficiently, whether that's identifying which payers are actively reimbursing for a particular service or learning which key doctors are prescribing specific products in their market.</p>
