<p>It's no secret the COVID-19 vaccines are a scare resource. But the combination of temperature constraints and no shows has led to vaccine waste.</p><p>A new platform&nbsp;called Dr. B&nbsp;is looking to curb this issue by connecting eligible patients to providers with extra vaccine doses.</p><p>"All people have to do is register at HIDRB.com and they are placed on a queue that is ordered based on local government guidelines," a Dr. B spokesperson wrote in an email to&nbsp;<i>MobiHealthNews.</i>&nbsp;"Providers will let Dr. B know how many extra doses they have, and Dr. B will send a text to the people on the top of the list."</p><p>Patients are matched up with providers in their area, and must respond to Dr. B in order to claim the dose. The company prioritizes vaccine distribution based on the eligibility criteria of the patient's state or local government.</p><p>The site officially launched in January. It's led by ZocDoc vet Cyrus Massoumi and Dr. Ian Lipkin. The pair joined forces with Vax Standby, which&nbsp;was working on a similar project.</p>
