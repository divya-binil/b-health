<p>Trina Histon, vice president of clinical product strategy at Woebot Health, discusses incorporating digital health tools into the provider workflow. Trina Histon recently accepted a new challenge at Woebot Health, the organisation behind a chatbot for mental healthcare, after working for Kaiser Permanente for almost 25 years. The integration of Woebot into clinical care will be the main objective of Histon's new position as vice president of clinical product strategy. She previously spent several years at Kaiser developing a method for getting patients access to digital mental health apps created by professionals. Histon sat down with MobiHealthNews to talk about the future of digital mental health solutions for more serious diseases as well as integrating applications into the workflow of providers.</p>
