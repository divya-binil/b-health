<p>OmniRoom, a platform that uses AI visibility to automate the inventory experience, was created by DARVIS (Data Analytic Real-World Visual Intelligence System), a technology for hospital and distribution Centre logistics and digitalization. DARVIS collaborates with a large German national hospital group to optimize their logistical flow for sterilization in order to free up time for medical professionals to perform one more surgery per day. &nbsp;</p><p>Productivity is essential in the hectic work world of today. This is especially true in the healthcare sector, where every second matters and inefficiency can have serious repercussions. OmniRoom offers customers a variety of digital services using computer vision, including OCR (optical character readers), inventory tracking, dock door scanning, and productivity monitoring.</p>
