Austin Speier, the company's chief strategy officer, stated that Click seeks to partner with pharmaceutical firms that see carefully crafted digital medicines as possible treatments on par with medications. In an interview with MobiHealthNews, Speier talked about the extended relationship and the potential benefits of pharmaceutical alliances for companies developing digital therapies.
