<p>The <a href="https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project#:~:text=The%20Human%20Genome%20Project%20was,than%20the%20original%20estimated%20budget.">Human Genome Project</a>, an international scientific cooperation on discovering the human genome, began in 1990. The goal of the undertaking was to identify the DNA sequence of the entire human genome. I was a medical student when the completion of the Human Genome Project was announced in 2003. I assumed, just like everyone else in the medical community, that <strong>this would change everything.</strong></p><p>Two decades have passed since then. And although the scientific progress is still outstanding, genetic testing did not become the new norm in healthcare. I want to know why.</p>
