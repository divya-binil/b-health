A major challenge in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic is the 'silent transmission' of coronavirus caused – often unknowingly – by asymptomatic individuals. Leveraging mHealth technologies such as mobile apps and wearable sensors, which can help to monitor COVID-19 patients and suspected cases, is a good way to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
