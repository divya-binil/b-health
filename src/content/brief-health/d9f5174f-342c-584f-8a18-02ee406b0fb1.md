<p>The second annual Healthcare Workplace Safety Trend Report from Stericycle, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRCL), a leading provider of medical waste management and secure information destruction solutions, has been released. It provides important insights into healthcare workers' perceptions of health and safety in their workplaces. Healthcare is undergoing a considerable shift due to the growth of the industry and the evolving nature of infectious diseases, which also presents new difficulties to be resolved. In order to help healthcare companies improve workplace safety standards and develop a quality care environment for providers and their patients, the study set out to better understand the viewpoints of healthcare administrators and providers on such difficulties. The primary findings from this year revealed that healthcare professionals now want greater education, resources, and tools for managing regulated and pharmaceutical waste (79%, up from 56%).</p>
