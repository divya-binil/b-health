<p>Bill Hudson, chief information officer of Integris Health, previews his HIMSS23 discussion on how information security is imperative for achieving organization-wide goals. Information security is frequently still viewed as an adjunct concern when compared to the primary mission of healthcare delivery, despite the increased visibility of cybersecurity efforts at U.S. health systems â€“ driven, of course, by the increased vulnerability of those organisations to increasingly brazen cybercriminals. But as two chief information officers will demonstrate at HIMSS23 in Chicago next month, that isn't the appropriate mentality. Bill Hudson, CIO at Integris Health, and Sonney Sapra, CIO at Samaritan Health Services, will argue that even with increased cybersecurity budgets, too many IT leaders still do not understand how infosec maturity is essential to achieving strategic goals in their panel discussion, "Cybersecurity as an Imperative to Achieve Your Organization's Strategic Goals."&nbsp;</p>
