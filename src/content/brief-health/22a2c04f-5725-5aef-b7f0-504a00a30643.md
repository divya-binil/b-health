<p>Healthcare organisations have been long aware of the frequency and related dangers of burnout in the medical field, but the stress and strain of the last 18 months of the COVID-19, have made it much more urgent.</p><p>Reports released by&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;major US healthcare organisations have&nbsp;called&nbsp;the situation “a public health crisis” and warned about the adverse impact “on the health and well-being of the&nbsp;public," citing the&nbsp;serious repercussions of healthcare worker burnout for patient safety and the quality of care.&nbsp;</p><p>While the term “burnout” is often used informally to indicate fatigue or boredom, leading psychologists define it a condition with&nbsp;three clear characteristics: emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, and inefficacy, or a low sense of personal accomplishment in one’s work.&nbsp;</p><p>Evidence suggests that burnout among physicians, nurses, and other clinicians is a serious and prevalent problem -- a costly one. Burnout is associated with higher rates of major medical errors&nbsp;and turnover.&nbsp;Even when clinicians suffering from burnout remain in their positions, they often cut back time spent working directly in clinical care.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
