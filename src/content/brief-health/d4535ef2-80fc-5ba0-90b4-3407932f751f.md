<p>HIMSSCast is back from a short holiday hiatus with our first annual predictions podcast. In this episode, host Jonah Comstock, <i>Healthcare IT News</i> Executive Editor Mike Miliard, <i>Healthcare Finance News</i> Managing Editor Susan Morse, and <i>MobiHealthNews</i> Managing Editor Laura Lovett engage in a roundtable discussion of trends and predictions for each of their respective coverage areas.</p><p>Notes: This episode was recorded Tuesday morning, before the Georgia results were final and before the tumultuous events at the Capitol. Additionally, Laura's prediction piece is forthcoming and will be added to the show notes later this afternoon.</p>
