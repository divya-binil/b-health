<p>A Boston-based startup is looking to help treat neurodegenerative disease with a smartphone-based digital therapeutic called Neuroglee.</p><p>This morning the startup got a boost when it closed a $10 million Series A round led by Openspace Ventures with participation from EDBI, Eisai Co and individual investors.&nbsp;</p><p>“Various techniques have been demonstrated to slow or improve cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease,” Aniket Singh Rajput, CEO of Neuroglee, told <i>MobiHealthNews</i> in an email.</p><p>“While the majority of this work has been demonstrated in the hospital setting in inpatient programs, we had a dream of bringing that type of therapy to patients in their own homes – especially to those patients who aren’t near a clinical center of excellence with this type of program.</p><p>"We will now be able to do that by working with patients’ clinicians across the country via our virtual care and digital therapy solutions.”</p>
