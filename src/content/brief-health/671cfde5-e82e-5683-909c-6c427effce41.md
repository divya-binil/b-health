<p><strong>The airline industry and healthcare are not two things you would usually put together but</strong> <strong>Jon Payne, technology strategist and innovator at InterSystems, argues they might be able to learn from each other.</strong></p><p>The healthcare industry has notoriously lagged behind in its investment in and adoption of information technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no exception. However, the opportunities – and need – to leverage AI for innovation, process improvement, patient and physician satisfaction, and patient outcomes improvement have never been greater.</p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic has already created a significant backlog of patients requiring medical appointments. And with GP surgeries in the UK now being urged to resume face-to-face appointments as soon as possible, having the most efficient booking system has never been more critical to ensuring wait times don’t skyrocket – and GPs don’t burn out.</p><p>However, according to the NHS, more than <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2019/01/missed-gp-appointments-costing-nhs-millions/">15 million appointments</a> in general practice are wasted each year in England when patients don’t show up (or dial in). This puts the cost of “did not attends” (DNAs) at £216 million – enough to pay for more than 2,300 full-time GPs.</p>
