<p>The Center for Connected Medicine (CCM) in partnership with KLAS Research conducted a report that was released in August entitled “<a href="https://connectedmed.com/resources/post-pandemic-telehealth-utilization-settles-in-at-20-or-less-of-medical-appointments/">The Intersection of Value and Telehealth: Survey Findings on Adoption and Utilization</a>.”</p><p>The report is based on a survey of nearly 100 executives, directors, and managers in technology, informatics, business, and clinical roles at U.S. health systems and hospitals during May and June of 2021—which was before the rise in COVID-19 cases due to the Delta variant.</p><p>The report states that “More than 80 percent of survey respondents said one-fifth or less of their organizations’ appointments were being conducted virtually, according to the CCM’s research. And of the small number of hospitals and health systems reporting 30 percent or more of patient volume as virtual, many said they expected that number to decline as the pandemic wanes.”</p><p>Further, “Despite lower post-pandemic telemedicine volumes at many health systems, the CCM found that provider organizations are looking to expand telehealth services to better manage the health of patient populations while keeping costs down. Chronic care management, behavioral health, and urgent care were the top three service lines cited by survey respondents for future expansion of telehealth.”</p>
