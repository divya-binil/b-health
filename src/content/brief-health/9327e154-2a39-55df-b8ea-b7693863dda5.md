<p>WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Glytec, the only provider of cloud-based insulin management software across the continuum of care, today announced it has been selected by CPS Solutions, LLC (CPS), a leading provider of enterprise pharmacy solutions to hospitals and health systems, to serve as an insulin management technology resource for CPS’ more than 2,200 pharmacy professionals across 800-plus healthcare facilities nationwide.
Through this collaboration, CPS client facilities may contract for Glytec’s eGlycemic Management System® (eGMS) and Glytec’s technical resources to be available to their healthcare professionals, empowering them to establish best-in-class glycemic management programs.
“Our eGMS will augment CPS’ existing resource portfolio and deepen the support services it provides to hospitals and health systems across the country.” “For nearly five decades, the CPS team has provided pharmacy departments with access to tools, resources, and services that leverage data to support evidence-based decisions,” said Len Gray, Pharm D, Senior Vice President of Purchasing and Data Management for CPS Solutions, Inc.
“As health systems prepare to report on the new CMS hospital harm measures related to glycemic management, it is imperative that pharmacists have the appropriate technology resources to optimize their facility’s insulin dosing,” said Stephanie Ostling Mason, PharmD, CDCES, Diabetes Clinical Pharmacist at Glytec.
Glytec is the insulin management software company for healthcare providers focused on improving the quality and cost of care.</p>
