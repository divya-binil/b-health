<p>The health system selected Biofourmis, which can analyze more than 120 biomarkers in real-time, to extend hospital-level care to patients across Central Florida. A multi-year deal with the linked health and digital therapeutics business will allow Orlando Health's Epic electronic health records to access data from the new hospital-at-home platform. Early in 2023, the new cutting-edge remote patient monitoring capabilities are anticipated to be made available by Orlando Health, a non-profit healthcare organisation serving the Southeast of the United States with 18 hospitals and emergency departments and five more under construction. According to the Bifourmis statement, expanding the virtual provider network can enhance patient outcomes, avoid readmissions to the hospital, hasten drug development, and bridge significant care gaps. The data-driven platform uses cutting-edge AI and machine-learning techniques to detect changes in physiological signal data from patient sensors, including heart rate, blood pulse wave, heart-rate variability, respiration rate, and many more.</p>
