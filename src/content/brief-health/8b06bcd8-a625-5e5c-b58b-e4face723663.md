<p>A group of former and current providers convened today in a HIMSS21 Global Conference Digital Session to discuss how digital transformation can be both contributing to and alleviating burnout.<br><br>It’s no secret that healthcare has a clinician burnout problem.</p><p>In fact, prior to the pandemic, 42% of physicians reported being burned&nbsp;out – a slight decrease from previous years, according to the <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/physician-health/physician-burnout-which-medical-specialties-feel-most-stress">American Medical Association</a>.
