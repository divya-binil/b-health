<p>The eHealth Exchange announced on Thursday that CRISP Shared Services intends to be the first participant in its planned Qualified Health Information Network as part of ONC's Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement.
Beyond including CRISP as its first QHIN participant, eHealth Exchange says it will be well positioned for TEFCA participation when the application period opens this fall, given its long experience supporting data exchange across a network including five federal agencies, 64 regional or state HIEs, 75% of all U.S. hospitals and more than 30 different EHRs. "eHealth Exchange has long been a cornerstone of CRISP Shared Services' ability to share data with organizations across the region, state and country, including with the federal government," said Brandon Neiswender, acting CEO for CRISP Shared Services, in a statement.
"The eHealth Exchange is thrilled that CRISP Shared Services is moving forward with TEFCA participation through our to-be-designated QHIN," added Jay Nakashima, executive director of eHealth Exchange.</p>
