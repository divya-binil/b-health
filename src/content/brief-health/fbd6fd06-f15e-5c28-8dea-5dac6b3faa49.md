<p>The bureau has new recommendations for healthcare organizations to address unpatched medical devices, which it says are increasingly being targeted in cyberattacks.<br><br>On Tuesday, the FBI issued a report offering recommendations to address a number of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in active medical devices stemming from outdated software, as well as the lack of security features in older hardware.
The new briefing is available to help healthcare IT managers act to identify and secure devices and raise employee awareness through risk mitigation training.</p>
