<p>They said that funding gaps, a skills shortage and inadequate interoperability prevent data from being shared and used.
Speakers at yesterday's event included Rachel Dunscombe, visiting professor and director of the digital health leadership programme at Imperial College London, Christian Lovis, professor and chairman of medical information sciences at the University Hospitals of Geneva, Edouard Duchesnay, research director in data science at CEA, a French research organisation, and Saila Rinne, head of eHealth, Well-being and Ageing at the European Commission’s DG Connect.
In the UK, Dunscombe said a dearth of 32,000 data science, AI and digital health workers is expected by 2030.
In the meantime, “If the data are interoperable it may be complicated to share them,” Lovis says.</p>
