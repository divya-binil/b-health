<p>CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A leader in continuous remote patient monitoring and data analytics, physIQ today announced a strategic collaboration with InCarda Therapeutics, Inc., a privately-held, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing first-of-their-kind inhaled therapies for cardiovascular diseases.
Syneos Health® (Nasdaq:SYNH), the only fully integrated biopharmaceutical solutions organization, recommended physIQ’s innovative monitoring solution to help advance InCarda’s clinical study of InRhythm™ (orally inhaled flecainide) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) – one of the most common heart arrhythmias that affects one in four adults over the age of 40.
The Phase III RESTORE-1 study is highly innovative in its use of wearable sensors and the FDA-cleared AF digital biomarker developed by physIQ.
</p><p>As soon as a patient experiences a suspected AF episode, they will self-apply a physIQ-provided biosensor patch which will confirm an AF diagnosis and direct the patient to the nearest trial site.
“Partnering with physIQ and Syneos Health has allowed us to develop and execute a patient-centric strategy to support the Phase 3 program of orally inhaled flecainide for acute cardioversion of recent-onset AF.
Using a biosensor combined with physIQ’s platform allows us to rapidly screen, qualify and enroll patients – bringing us steps closer to intervening that much earlier,” added Tammy D’Lugin-Monroe, RN, MA, Vice President, Global Head, Therapeutic Strategy and Innovation, Syneos Health.
physIQ is the leader in digital medicine, dedicated to generating unprecedented health insight using continuous wearable biosensor data and advanced analytics.
With applications in both clinical trial support and healthcare, physIQ is transforming continuous physiological data into insight for health systems, payers, and pharmaceutical companies.</p>
