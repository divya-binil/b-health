<p>WHO-Europe and Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society this week set a new agenda of transatlantic collaboration in digital health, signing a memorandum of understanding marking it.
“I am extremely pleased to sign this agreement with HIMSS, paving the way for a new, harmonized approach to the digital transformation of health systems in Europe and beyond,” said Dr Hans Henri P. This new agreement empowers WHO-Europe to increase its capacity to support countries in transforming health systems in the region through data and technology.</p>
