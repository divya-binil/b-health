title: 'From Surgeries To Keeping Company: The Place Of Robots In Healthcare'
---

Assisting surgeries, disinfecting rooms, dispensing medication, keeping company: believe it or not these are the tasks medical robots will soon undertake in hospitals, pharmacies, or your nearest doctor’s office. These new ‘colleagues’ will definitely make a difference in every field of medicine. Here’s our overview to understand robotics in healthcare better so that everyone can prepare for the appearance of mechanic helpers in medical facilities.

Metallic allies for the benefit of the vulnerable
While there are concerns for machines replacing people in the workforce, we believe there are advantages to the renewal of the distribution of tasks. Machines don’t need sleep or food, don’t have prejudices and definitely won’t grunt about why they need to complete the same monotonous tasks for the thousandth time – for example washing up the hospital floor or bringing medicine up the 10th floor.

Thus, we could imagine how healthcare robots could take over administrative and/or monotonous tasks that people like to skip anyway while medical professionals, doctors, and nurses can truly devote their precious time to the job that they signed up for – caring for the sick and vulnerable.
