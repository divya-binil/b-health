<p>Adhering to an episodic or long-term health treatment plan can be overwhelming for many patients. They often do not remember everything their doctor tells them during visits, health portals are cumbersome and difficult to access, and the healthcare literacy level of patients can vary widely. Secure, HIPAA-compliant communication pathways can keep patients on track by providing step-by-step guidance for anything from routine preventive care to complex medical procedures. By prompting patients to adhere to their care plans using simple, easy to understand messages, healthcare providers are able to effect better outcomes, the care team is significantly more efficient, and patients are more satisfied.</p>
