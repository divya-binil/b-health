<p>The agreement supports the HL7 FHIR community's usage of the WHO's international classifications and terminologies and will give member states access to a testing environment and standards documentation. In order to encourage the adoption of open interoperability standards, which the World Health Organization (WHO) claims are essential for the creation of equitable and research-based digital health, the World Health Organization and HL7 have inked an agreement. In a post on its website on July 3, the organization stated that as part of its global digital health strategy, "there is a call for WHO to provide global guidance on interoperability standards adoption and guidance on how WHO clinical, public health, and data guidance can be translated into digital health systems."</p>
