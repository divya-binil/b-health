<p>With disinformation and confusion about COVID-19 on the rise, effective patient engagement is taking on an even greater role.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Studies have shown that engaged patients show <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4078275/#R22">improved health outcomes</a>&nbsp;and that effective tools can enhance <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6060529/">service delivery</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>But it's not always simply a question of communicating more. Communicating with impact is the real key â€“ and innovators and vendors are exploring the best ways to do so. &nbsp;</p><p>Two such teams are mPulse Mobile and Magellan Rx Management, which&nbsp;recently collaborated to address social isolation and loneliness in nearly 1,800 people with chronic and specialty conditions across the United States.</p><p>By using mPulse's conversational artificial intelligence platform, the companies say they were able to conduct dialogues via text messages with participants on a variety of health-related topics during a 45-day period. &nbsp;</p>
