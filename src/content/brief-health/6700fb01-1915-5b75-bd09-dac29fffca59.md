London-based virtual surgery platform Proximie is looking to tackle surgical connectivity challenges with its augmented reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence tools that let doctors remotely scrub into operations.
Proximie isn’t the only digital tool looking to help new surgeons train either.</p>
