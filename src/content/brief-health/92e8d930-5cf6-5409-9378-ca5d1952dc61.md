<p>At HIMSS22, Paul Cerrato, senior research analyst at Mayo Clinic Platform, and Dr. John Halamka, president of MCP, will discuss the future of digital health.<br><br>Digital health tools have been pitched as a way to help fight health disparities and improve access, however, the technologies could also widen the care gap if not deployed correctly.
MobiHealthNews asked Paul Cerrato, senior research analyst at Mayo Clinic Platform, about the future of digital tools in healthcare, and his upcoming presentation at HIMSS22 with Dr. John Halamka.
MobiHealthNews: How do you think digital health tools could help address challenges of health equity?
Cerrato: Yes, digital health tools have the potential to create disparities for several reasons, not the least of which is many come to market without strong scientific evidence to support them.
Cerrato: At Mayo Clinic, we have created a suite of validation tools to improve accuracy, fitness of purpose and equity of digital tools currently being developed.</p>
