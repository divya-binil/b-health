<ul><li>The use of telehealth for patient visits seems to have leveled off at 20% or fewer of all appointments,&nbsp;more than a year and a half after COVID-19 first spurred an unprecedented jump in utilization, according to a new survey from KLAS Research and the Center for Connected Medicine.</li><li>More than 80% of hospital executive respondents to the <a href="https://connectedmed.com/resources/post-pandemic-telehealth-utilization-settles-in-at-20-or-less-of-medical-appointments/">survey fielded in May and June</a> this year said one-fifth or fewer of their facility's appointments were being conducted virtually. Of the hospitals and health systems reporting 30% or more of their volume is virtual,&nbsp;many said they expected that percentage to decline over the long term as the pandemic wanes in the U.S.</li><li>Despite use of telehealth&nbsp;dwindling from last year's peak,&nbsp;many provider organizations say they're looking to expand their virtual care services to better manage patient populations while keeping costs down. The top three areas for future telehealth expansion cited by survey respondents were chronic care management, behavioral health and urgent care.</li></ul>
