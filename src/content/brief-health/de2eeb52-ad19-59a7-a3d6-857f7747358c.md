<p>According to a study published in JAMA Network Open, more primary care doctors using EHRs had better patient A1c levels, hypertension management, and breast cancer screening rates. Increased primary care physician usage of EHRs was linked to better quality outcomes in specific areas, including diabetes and hypertension management and breast cancer screening compliance, according to a cross-sectional study. The study, which was undertaken by Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital in 2021 and was published in JAMA Network Open, looked at 291 primary care physicians' demographic and practise traits as well as their time spent using the EHR. PCPs used the EHR for a total of 145.9 minutes each day on average. EHR time and panel-level performance of haemoglobin A1c control, hypertension control, and other outcomes were found to be significantly correlated.</p>
