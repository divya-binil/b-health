<p>Healthcare trends hype cycle: showing the 50 of the most promising medical technologies where we at The Medical Futurist see them stand today.<br><br>I have been analysing technological trends in healthcare for over 10 years. I have seen currents come and go, and I was <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/5-certain-things-about-the-future-of-physicians-insights-from-a-new-e-book">making forecasts</a> about them, too – and even shared the way I do it, <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/learn-forecasting">how you can get your own crystal ball</a> and learn forecasting.&nbsp;</p><p>Why do I find it important? Because by analysing the possible outcomes, we learn how to avoid the hype that leads to headlines but no results (<a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/digital-health-ventures-that-flew-too-close-to-the-sun">remember Theranos</a>?), as it can result in misleading information around the technology – ultimately leading to mistrust by users. On the other hand, certain technologies and companies need to be highlighted as they might bring the transformation of healthcare a step closer to reality.</p>
