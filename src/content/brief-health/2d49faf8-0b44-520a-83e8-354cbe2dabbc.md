<p>R&amp;D to discover, develop and deliver transformative medicines that address important treatment gaps in severe illnesses, at a speed that rapidly and appropriately meets our communities’ health needs, is essential to improving health care systems and outcomes.
We saw health care systems become overwhelmed, indicating the need for newer and faster scientific and medical innovations to meet the emergent crisis.
Innovation is at the core of our business and is key to how we identify novel therapeutic targets, new innovative and better medicines that keep patients out of the hospital, and ultimately improve health outcomes of the communities in which we live and work by preventing morbidity and mortality.
Technologies like telehealth have received an incredible boost during COVID-19 and taking lessons from this global health challenge can lead us to new and more accessible ways to enable communities to be healthier and more resilient before another crisis occurs.
</p><p>The spirit of innovation is how responsive we can be to solve the world’s health challenges, and for our industry, the speed at which we can develop new medicines that rapidly and appropriately meet our communities’ health needs is essential, as it is our key contribution to health care systems and outcomes.
A regulatory and reimbursement ecosystem that broadly rewards, and protects, innovation has a direct impact to incentivize research, development and investment in new medicines and medical technologies, including medicines for rare conditions, and in turn allows Europeans to access those medicines and technologies for better health outcomes.

Our industry is committed to solving society’s biggest health challenges as quickly as we can, and a rewarding innovation environment is critical to enable this success.</p>
