<p>Getting up to speed with competitor Apple, Fitbit has gained medical device clearances in the U.S. and Europe for its smartwatch electrocardiogram app.</p><p>The wearables giant announced Monday its ECG app got a green light from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EU's CE mark. The regulatory approvals open up the capability&nbsp;for its ECG app to&nbsp;track users'&nbsp;heart rhythms for signs of atrial fibrillation.</p><p>It follows in the footsteps of the Apple Watch receiving&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/new-apple-watch-receives-fda-clearance-for-built-ecg"><strong>FDA clearance</strong></a>&nbsp;in 2018&nbsp;for its ECG feature. Samsung&nbsp;got&nbsp;an FDA nod in August for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355646/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-heart-monitoring-ecg-fda-clearance"><strong>ECG monitoring app</strong></a>&nbsp;as part of the Galaxy Watch 3.</p><p>Amazon also recently jumped into the wearables space with its <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/competing-apple-and-fitbit-amazon-launches-health-wearable-tracks-activity-body-fat-and"><strong>Amazon Halo fitness tracker</strong></a>. That device, which does not offer heart rhythm tracking, monitors&nbsp;activity and sleep trends and has&nbsp;tools to measure body fat and tone of voice as an indicator of overall well-being.</p><p>Google is in the process of <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/a-play-for-consumer-health-data-google-acquires-wearables-giant-fitbit-for-2-1b"><strong>acquiring Fitbit</strong></a>, which now has 30 million active users, for $2.1 billion. The deal still needs to be approved by regulators.</p><p>Fitbit unveiled the ECG app as a feature on its newest device, Fitbit Sense, which will be available in October.<br><br><a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/fitbit-s-ecg-smartwatch-app-gets-fda-nod-to-track-heart-rhythm-irregularity">Read on fiercehealthcare.com</a></p>
