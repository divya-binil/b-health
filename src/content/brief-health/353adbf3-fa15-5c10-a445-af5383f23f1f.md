<p>When we tap into the energy of our calling, we become unstoppable.&nbsp; We see the greater purpose for our journey in medicine. We grow and expand into the person we are meant to be who shows up even more fully in every area of life. &nbsp;And that’s when success is revealed to us in every moment.<br><br>It could be on the final stretch of the 24-hour shift that redefined the meaning of the word “nonstop.”</p><p>It could be the third time you answer the phone to clarify an order because the new computer system only allows for the order to be formatted in a certain way.</p><p>It could be when you take stock of your life and career and things don’t add up. You’re not where you thought you’d be in your career, finances, or life.</p><p>But what if the very things you think are minuses, obstacles, and challenges are the very things that are taking you to your desired outcome, if only you could stop thinking of them as stumbling blocks and see them as stepping stones?</p><p>What if you could see the moments of feeling uncomfortable and discouraged as defining the next steps to break through to success in life and in medicine?</p><p>Are you willing to give up now and accept where you are as final when you can bring the target into view with a few shifts?</p><p>The success you seek is the natural unfolding.</p>
