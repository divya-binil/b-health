<p>An armada of digital health technologies is set to bring healthcare to the 21st century. Artificial intelligence can make the <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/artificial-intelligence-could-solve-alarm-fatigue-in-hospitals/">alarm fatigue epidemic</a> a thing of the past. Medical-grade, <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/the-7-must-haves-for-the-doctor-of-the-21st-century/">portable diagnostic devices</a> make patients the point-of-care. With such potentials and more, it’s no wonder that <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/national-digital-health-strategies-around-the-world/">some governments</a> are developing national digital health strategies to transform their current systems. A survey from the American Hospital Association suggests that <a href="https://medium.com/the-slalom-daily-dose/most-healthcare-digital-transformations-fail-start-small-with-data-governance-2b99cf70fee8">around 85% of hospital executives</a> already factor digital innovation as part of their long-term strategy.</p><p>Bringing about such a change requires heavy investments. To deliver its digital transformation ambitions up to 2024, the U. K.’s National Health Service (NHS) is expected to need <a href="https://www.digitalhealth.net/2020/06/nhs-digital-transformation-remains-tough/">around £8.1 billion</a>. Digital health investments already <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/5-things-we-learnt-about-investments-in-digital-health-new-e-book/">skyrocketed in 2020</a>, which was the record-breaking year in the industry. But with national endeavours, it’s billions in taxpayers’ money that are at play. As such, the question of whether those transformations deliver value for money solutions looms.</p>
