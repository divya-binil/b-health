<p>Decentralized clinical trials offer many advantages over traditional site-based studies: Are they here to stay?<br><br>Traditional clinical trials place a significant burden on both patients and family caregivers. Study participants face costs for transportation, lodging, meals, and dependent care.¹&nbsp;²&nbsp;These burdens mean that getting adequate patient enrollment is one of the top issues facing medical investigators.²&nbsp;³</p><p>With the rise of COVID-19, enrolling patients in traditional studies has become even more difficult. <a href="https://veradigm.com/veradigm-news/conducting-research-at-the-point-of-care/">Decentralized clinical trials</a> offer an alternative means of study participation. They offer several advantages over traditional, site-based clinical trials. However, without the proper infrastructure, conducting these studies can also be difficult.</p><p>In this article, we discuss how decentralized clinical trials differ from site-based clinical trials. We look at the advantages they offer—as well as the difficulties they present. We also look at <a href="https://veradigm.com/veradigm-studysource-point-of-care-research/">StudySource</a>, an innovative solution from Veradigm® that can help investigators run decentralized clinical trials more smoothly and easily.</p>
