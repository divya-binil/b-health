    description: >-
      The founders of Azalea Health, while working at a medical laboratory
      company, observed that most EHRs were clunky, and physicians had a hard
      time understanding how to use them. As a result they were determined to
      develop a solution that would simplify the life of physicians and
      administrators.


      They recognized the opportunity to build a healthcare IT solution that
      would be truly cloud-based and as simple to use as an email tool. Drawing
      on local university talent, they essentially created a technology
      incubator environment. The resulting cloud-based healthcare management and
      medical billing solution connects the clinical with the financial side of
      a practice and integrates easily with existing systems.
