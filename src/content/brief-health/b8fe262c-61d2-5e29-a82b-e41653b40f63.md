Due to an error in the software administered by NCS Pte Ltd (NCS), about 7700 individuals received inaccurate healthcare and intermediate and long term subsidies, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on February 16 2019. Due to an error in the software administered by NCS Pte Ltd (NCS), about 7700 individuals received inaccurate healthcare and intermediate and long term subsidies, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on February 16 2019.

The individuals affected were those who had their Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) card applications and renewals processed from September 18 to October 10 2018. CHAS enables Singapore citizens from lower to middle-income households and all Pioneers* to receive subsidies for medical and dental care at participating GP and dental clinics near their home.

Specifically, the error occurred in the computer system when it calculated means test results. MOH said it is working with healthcare service providers and scheme administrators to reach out to the affected individuals.

About 1,300 of them who received lower subsidies will have the difference reimbursed to them and another 6,400 individuals received higher subsidies due to the error. However, they do need to return the additional subsidises disbursed.
