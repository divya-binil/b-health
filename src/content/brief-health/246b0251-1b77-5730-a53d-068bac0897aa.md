<p>The business said that after "a time of significant growth and recruiting," it was necessary to restructure. OneStudyTeam, a Reify Health startup that provides a workflow platform for clinical trials, has let go of 160 people, or about 25% of its workforce. "We can attest to having taken the extremely tough choice to part ways with some of our team members. OneStudyTeam was developed by a variety of people, and we are appreciative of their contributions to our goal of hastening the advancement of treatments that can save patients' lives. We concluded that we need to restructure our team going into 2023 to streamline operations after a period of extremely rapid growth and hiring," a company spokesperson told MobiHealthNews in an email.</p>
