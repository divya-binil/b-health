Wearing of face masks in public is now part of basic health protocols meant to prevent coronavirus spread. The expected shortages in supply of surgical masks, however, have led many people to use homemade masks and mask alternatives (eg, bandanas or neck fleece). Since the efficacy of these improvised masks has not been proven, researchers from Duke University have proposed a simple optical method to measure the effectiveness of such masks in reducing the spread of respiratory droplets during regular speech (Fischer et al. 2020).
