      When things are clear, easy and relevant for patients, providers form
      stronger relationships, minimize administrative burden and achieve better
      financial results, so what's good for patients is good for providers. At
      Cedar, we foster that mutually beneficial relationship through proven
      expertise and modern technology. We combine the best techniques of
      fintech, ad tech, consumer and healthcare to help providers understand and
      engage patients more effectively.


      Team-oriented. Fast-paced. Mission-led. We bring together a deep
      understanding of data science, technology, experience and design to solve
      an important healthcare problem in a unique way. Our team includes a
      diverse group of talented, problem-solvers and change-makers who are
      building something transformational. If you thrive when pushing
      boundaries, moving mountains and challenging the status quo, you'll find
      your crew here.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> 					 <p><em>One of the nation’s largest health systems sees a 7x ROI with Cedar Pay; demonstrates impact of investing in the consumer experience</em></p>    <p><a href="https://www.novanthealth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Novant Health</a>, one of the largest healthcare systems in the Southeast, has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cedar.com/novant-health/?utm_source=press-release&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=Novant%20Health&amp;utm_content=cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">significantly improved</a>&nbsp;its patient financial experience by partnering with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cedar.com/?utm_source=press-release&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=Novant%20Health&amp;utm_content=cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cedar</a>, an enterprise healthcare engagement platform that improves the end-to-end consumer financial journey. By investing in&nbsp;Cedar Pay, Cedar’s post-visit billing and payment platform, Novant Health continues to lead the way when it comes to bringing digital innovation to the revenue cycle.</p>    <p>For years, Novant Health had worked to modernize their revenue cycle organization, leaning on mail, email and EHR communications to reach patients. While these initiatives drove incremental improvements, the health system identified two key opportunities in 2019 to truly enable a more consumer-centric experience for their patients:</p>    <ol><li><strong>Combining Novant Health’s acute and ambulatory services into a single billing experience.&nbsp;</strong>While the organization had tried to combine physician and facility billing for years, they had always been met with pushback from vendors or complex EHR upgrades that could fundamentally break their existing processes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Making bill payment a low friction, easy to navigate experience for both patients and team members.</strong>&nbsp;Novant Health wanted to help patients understand how their payments work and how their insurance benefits applied. In order to do so, they needed to personalize the experience, using mobile technology that consumers were already familiar with.&nbsp;</li></ol>    <p>To <a href="https://www.cedar.com/novant-health/?utm_source=press-release&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=Novant%20Health&amp;utm_content=cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">address these challenges</a>, Novant Health invested in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cedar.com/cedar-pay/?utm_source=press-release&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=Novant%20Health&amp;utm_content=cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cedar Pay</a>. Cedar Pay delivers personalized billing through outreach, messaging and bill resolution based on a variety of unique factors and preferences. The platform is fully integrated with Novant Health’s existing Epic EHR system across both hospital billing and physician billing.&nbsp;</p>    <p>As a result of their implementation of Cedar Pay, Novant Health has seen a material rise in collections over a 12-month period, amounting to tens of millions of dollars, as well as:&nbsp;</p>    <ul><li>90% patient satisfaction score</li><li>87% of collections now completely self-serviced</li><li>43% drop in days to collect</li></ul>    <p>“Investing in a consumer engagement platform like Cedar is something we had wanted to do for a long time as part of our digital transformation strategy—we wanted to create a singular financial experience that allows our patients to pay with the technology we keep in our pockets,” said Geoff Gardner, senior vice president of Finance at Novant Health. “Cedar has been a great partner to us in our commitment to delivering a remarkable healthcare experience to our community; the results truly speak for themselves, as we have been able to increase collections while also improving patient satisfaction.”&nbsp;</p>    <p>“At Cedar, we know that engaged, happy patients lead to better outcomes, and the best way to improve patient satisfaction is by implementing consumer-friendly technology,” said Florian Otto, CEO and co-founder of Cedar. “It’s been a privilege working with such an innovative health system like Novant Health, and we look forward to continuing our partnership and continuing to impact the lives of their patients.”&nbsp;</p>    <p>To learn more about how Novant Health has seen a 7x ROI through its strategic partnership with Cedar, read the full case study&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cedar.com/novant-health/?utm_source=press-release&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=Novant%20Health&amp;utm_content=cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>    <p><strong>About Cedar</strong></p>    <p>Cedar is committed to improving the healthcare billing experience for all.
