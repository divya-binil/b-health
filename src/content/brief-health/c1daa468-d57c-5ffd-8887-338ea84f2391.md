<p>The home diagnostics company also cut 170 manufacturing jobs in the summer. 388 individuals, or nearly 26% of Cue Health's personnel, will be let go as part of a bigger cost-cutting strategy. The home diagnostics business, which fired 170 manufacturing workers in the summer, has announced yet another wave of layoffs. The layoffs are anticipated to occur in March, according to a filing Cue made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Given our rapid expansion over the last three years and the present difficult macroeconomic environment, the Cue Health leadership team has been assessing how to best position the company for the future for the past several months, a Cue spokeswoman told MobiHealthNews. We have decided, after much deliberation, to cut our global staff by roughly 26%, which translates to 388 employees leaving Cue.</p>
