<p>In order to speed up research and bring about improvements in treatments and care around the world, Flatiron Health has entered into a new partnership agreement with the London-based provider of precision medicine software, Life bit. This will allow its researchers to securely access sensitive, real-world data on cancer patients. By using Life bit's ground-breaking federated Trusted Research Environment technology, authorized researchers will have worldwide access to high-quality real-world data on cancer patients while maintaining their privacy and security. One of Southeast Texas' major not-for-profit health institutions, Memorial Hermann Health System, has joined forces with Babyscripts, the leading virtual care platform for managing obstetrics. the barriers to care that contribute to Houston's (and Harris County's) rates of maternal mortality will be targeted and addressed by the partnership between Memorial Hermann and Babyscripts.</p>
