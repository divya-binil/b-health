<p>But most of the data that the industry is processing is human-generated, meaning it’s messy and riddled with errors, and often manually inputted from Excel spreadsheets into various disparate platforms and technology systems.
It’s extremely challenging to efficiently streamline the processing of healthcare’s messy, inconsistent data, which is why we’ve seen that it’s been so hard to pull insights from healthcare’s stores of data, not to mention solve the industry’s interoperability problems.
