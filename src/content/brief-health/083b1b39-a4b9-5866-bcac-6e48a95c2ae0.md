<p>Here is a list of seven medical technologies I trust will be gaining momentum in 2023 - and will have a significant effect on healthcare in general. It's always beneficial to pause for a moment and consider what lies ahead, especially as we have just ushered in a brand-new year. After briefly reviewing current developments, let's concentrate on what is yet to come. Here is a list of seven medical technologies that, in my opinion, will be on the rise in 2023 and have a big impact on healthcare as a whole. A shortage of staff is a significant issue facing healthcare systems all over the world, and asynchronous telemedicine offers a logical solution. The WHO projections predicting a shortage of 10 million healthcare workers by 2030 have been brought up so frequently over the past few years that I can only hope you are not completely sick of hearing about it.</p>
