<p>Ampersand Health is launching a new dermatology app for patients, the latest in a series of disease-specific apps aimed at prolonging periods of remission. The latest in a line of disease-specific smartphone apps from Ampersand Health is a dermatological app for users, with the goal of extending periods of remission for a variety of chronic inflammatory illnesses like Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and Inflammatory Arthritis. The Ampersand Health platform helps hospitals provide patients with chronic disorders with safer, proactive, and more individualised care. The apps allow patients to self-manage their disease as a supplement to the remote monitoring platform. The clinician platform from Ampersand Health can notify medical staff of patients who are not adhering to their care plan or who are at risk of a flare-up. This enables them to provide patients with the care they need while excluding those who are healthy.</p>
