<p>Today, Sema4 (Nasdaq: SMFR), a health intelligence company, announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire GeneDx, a leader in genomic testing and analysis, at a purchase price representing approximately $623 million, strengthening its market-leading health intelligence and genomic screening offerings.
In connection with the acquisition, Sema4 has also entered into definitive agreements for a private placement financing to sell $200 million in Class A common stock at a price of $4.00 per share from a syndicate of institutional investors, including Pfizer.
The companies expect to complete the acquisition in the second quarter of 2022, positioning Sema4 to grow and scale its genomic offerings and further transform the standard of care in health systems and for patients throughout their lives.
