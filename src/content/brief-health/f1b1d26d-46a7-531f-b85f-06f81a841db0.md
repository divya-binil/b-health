<p>Women in healthcare leadership must own their narratives and COVID has, unexpectedly, created more opportunities for female leaders.<br><br>We will speak to four women who are changing the face of healthcare in a number of different ways, from leadership to securing funding for AI start-ups to implementing value-based healthcare to the creation of smart services that address the real needs of real families.
Women in healthcare leadership on the up
Brigitte’s words will no doubt offer hope to the millions of women who are emerging from the pandemic feeling professionally, mentally, and emotionally bruised.
Out with the old – A new job description for women in healthcare leadership
But Brigitte believes the pandemic has re-written the job description for leaders, ushering in a new era of leadership and a raft of new opportunities for female leaders, especially for women in healthcare leadership positions.
Having worked across three sectors within the healthcare system – not-for-profit, public, and private – Brigitte knows just how crucial it is that women have a seat at the table, and she sees that things are changing for women in healthcare leadership.
Empathy, openness, and partnership are being heard and are being welcomed, and these are all qualities that women possess,” Brigitte says, adding that diversity of opinion is a key ingredient for any innovative organization.
Then, after a while, it will become natural and we will see that the change we wanted to achieve has become an embedded part of the culture,” Brigitte says.
“I have an amazing support network that includes both men and women, and it’s thanks to my support network that I am where I am today,” Brigitte says.</p>
