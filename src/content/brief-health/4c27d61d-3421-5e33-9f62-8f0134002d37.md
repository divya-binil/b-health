<p>The letter represents the diversity of groups across the health care spectrum whose constituencies are impacted by telehealth policy – from consumer groups representing mental health, chronic disease, primary care; and providers including physicians, nurses, physical therapists; to employers representing millions of Americans who receive their coverage through their jobs.”
That said, “The letter calls on the Senate to pass legislation that would extend critical telehealth flexibilities, including provisions to waive provider and patient location limitations, remove in-person requirements for telemental health, ensure continued access to clinically appropriate controlled substances without in-person requirements, and increase access to telehealth services in the commercial market, including for those with a high-deductible health plans coupled with a health savings account (HDHP-HSA).”</p>
