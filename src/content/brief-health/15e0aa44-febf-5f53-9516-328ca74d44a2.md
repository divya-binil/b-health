<p>Alpha Medical, a virtual primary care group that empowers women to take control of their healthcare by offering a medical team specifically trained for a woman’s unique needs, announces it will prescribe PAXLOVID, an investigational medication used to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and children 12 years of age and older, and are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, under a EUA.
Since Alpha offers continuity of care through dedicated providers that patients can return to with every visit, their personalized treatment plan can also take into account potential drug interactions and other pre-existing conditions that may affect their eligibility for PAXLOVID.</p>
