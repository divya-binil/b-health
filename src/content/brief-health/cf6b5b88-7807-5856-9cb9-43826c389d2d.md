Genomics needs more talented software engineers.

There is a significant gap between how software is currently developed in this space versus how it should be developed. The vast majority of genomics-related software is not written with speed or reliability in mind. Too often, projects have no documentation within the code itself and no tests. Instead, a single individual who built the tool and has worked with the code since its inception is solely responsible for ensuring that the results &quot;still look good&quot; between releases (in an ad hoc manner, no less)â€”a claim that I think is incredibly generous given the breadth and complexity of evaluating genomics results. This state of affairs makes it difficult for anyone other than the original author to contribute to these code bases, further cementing the one-maintainer policy.
