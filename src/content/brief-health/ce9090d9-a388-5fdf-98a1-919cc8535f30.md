<p>According to experts, what we currently refer to as "healthcare" won't exist in 10 to 20 years. It will undergo extensive redesign as a result of medical and technology advancements, pressure to increase access and cost of care, and the need to provide patients with an experience that reflects our evolving attitudes and behaviours toward health. Socioeconomic determinants of health are gaining popularity as a focus area that might greatly influence patient health and outcomes as we envision the healthcare systems of the (near) future. Tech-based solutions, such as the use of artificial intelligence to improve efficiency and/or to give more individualised treatment, appear to take the lead when it comes to innovation efforts intended to correct the unsustainability throughout healthcare systems today.</p>
