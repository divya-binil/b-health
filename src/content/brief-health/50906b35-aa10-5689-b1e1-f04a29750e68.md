<p>With regard to pharmaceuticals and digital health, we are at an intriguing turning point. Many pharma companies are taking a step back to strategically analyse how they have performed in practice and the impact they have had on both patient and business results several years after the first iteration of digital patient solutions was initially deployed. Unfortunately, many platforms created by pharmaceutical corporations or integrated into already-existing platforms have fallen short of fulfilling those demands. For instance, just approximately 3% of patients currently use digital solutions. One potential explanation is that many pharmaceutical companies initially tried to build solutions on their own or purchased pre-built platforms with generic infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
