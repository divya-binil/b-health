Since moving to the Health Cloud, CHESS has reduced the rate of 30-day all-cause readmissions by 23%, driving more than $3 million in value across MSSP, NextGen, and Medicare Advantage patient populations. </p> <blockquote></blockquote> <p> CHESS, a physician-led healthcare services company, implements patient management processes that help improve the quality of care and lower costs. Founded in 2012, CHESS aims to improve value-based care delivery for its patient population through a variety of initiatives to address high readmission rates, manual care management processes, disparate data sources, and decentralized care coordination. </p><p> CHESS wanted to transform how it managed care transitions to help identify higher-risk patients earlier, engage with them more often, avoid costly inpatient treatment as appropriate, and ultimately achieve better health outcomes at lower care costs. They also wanted to standardize transitional care management (TCM) practices across more than 3,000 provider locations, and unify patient data from disparate sources to create a longitudinal patient record that could provide comprehensive care insights to help improve clinical decisions. </p><p> The health system recognized the need to unify data used by more than 20,000 providers to gain a 360-degree view of patients to accurately track and manage risk, cost, and quality performance. Using that consolidated data to fuel advanced analytics would give CHESS’s providers intelligent, automated point-of-care workflows to enhance care delivery and engagement, as well as help flag and close coding and care gaps. </p><p> The Innovaccer Health Cloud’s Data Activation Platform—the <a referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" target="_blank" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finnovaccer.com%2Fawards%2Fbest-in-klas-data-platform&amp;esheet=52876242&amp;newsitemid=20220908005721&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=%231+healthcare+data+and+analytics+platform+according+to+KLAS&amp;index=4&amp;md5=c5e995a84594b0fd67a00d4e16c90c01" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">#1 healthcare data and analytics platform according to KLAS</a>—enabled CHESS to centralize patient data siloed across myriad EHR and other IT systems and care settings into a unified patient record. That longitudinal patient record now serves as a single source of truth for its care managers to use and automate CHESS’s standardized care management process for recently discharged patients, eliminating costly manual intervention, and administrative overhead. </p><p> The Health Cloud also helped CHESS streamline its value-based initiatives with advanced, actionable analytics that leverage the longitudinal patient record view, and seamlessly integrate into automated workflows that support real-time decision-making to enhance whole-person, equitable care delivery. </p><p> Using the Innovaccer Health Cloud’s TCM solution, CHESS has so far achieved: </p><ul> <li> A standardized, automated TCM process automation that begins when patients are released from the hospital </li> <li> A 23% reduction in 30-day readmissions among intervened populations </li> <li> $3+ million in generated value </li> <li> Similar value for Medicare Advantage, NextGen ACOs, and MSSP plans </li> </ul><p> “One of the things we appreciate about Innovaccer is its ability to identify and ingest multiple data sources,” said Dr. Yates Lennon, president and chief transformation officer at CHESS Health Solutions. “We've gone through an extensive validation process and have worked through quality measures, cost and utilization, and risk to verify the data and make sure it's correct. We want to be sure that when we put data in front of physicians, it is accurate and dependable so we don't lose engagement.” </p><p> <b>About CHESS Health Solutions</b> </p><p> CHESS is a physician-led health care services company that empowers clinicians and health systems to make the transition to value-based medicine. Practicing medicine in a model where providers are financially rewarded for improving the quality of care and reducing the cost of care they deliver to patients allows for the introduction of innovative care models that improve outcomes. With careful attention to high quality and efficiency, CHESS negotiates payer contracts that enable physicians to share in cost savings and leverages advanced analytics to build and measure the success of the value transformation. CHESS creates a healthcare environment that is both patient-centered and clinician-friendly.
