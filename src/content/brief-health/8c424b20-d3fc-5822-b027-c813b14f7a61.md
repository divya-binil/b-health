<p>Health care in the U.S. and Canada is facing inadequate standards, with family doctors in Canada having only 10 minutes per patient, leading to high stress levels and even suicide rates in the medical profession, with a need for a designated outlet for support, such as a listserv for physicians to share and find solutions to their problems. Many people believe that the health care system in the United States is insufficient. I recently discovered that family doctors in Canada only get 10 minutes per patient during an online course. I'm not sure who makes or enforces this rule, and I'm not sure why somebody would take a position like that. As an introvert, I am aware of the strain of being there for others all day, but 10 minutes for a quick checkup, a prescription refill, or an order for tests does not seem like a reasonable minimum for health care. As a PCP, I am aware that each medical specialty has its own unique stressors. For instance, the cognitive stress that PCPs suffer while dealing with patients who have particular health views or desires and who may chatter on for hours about their bad interactions with others in operation rooms, labour and delivery rooms, and other situations. Yet, the majority of doctors are frequently able to respond to these difficulties appropriately. There are, of course, sometimes days when we could feel overworked, irritated, and unable to relate to our patients. Where can we turn to deal with this tension, then? There hasn't historically been a specific venue for it. Life magazine wrote an article in the 1960s about the hardships experienced by rural doctors who worked long hours.</p>
