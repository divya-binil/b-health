<p>Several nurses have been in the news lately for their creative medical innovations or entrepreneurship and philanthropic efforts aimed at improving the healthcare experience for patients and clinicians.&nbsp;</p><p>Four stories to know:</p><p>1. Barbara Wadsworth, DNP, RN, COO and chief nursing officer at Radnor Township, Pa.-based Main Line Health, <a href="https://www.mainlinehealth.org/news/2021/11/09/with-own-invention-main-line-healths-coo-chief-nursing-officer">invented</a> a fall-injury-prevention device. The health system has applied for a patent for the device, which is a portable airbag that is deployed if a sensor detects a patient is falling.</p><p>2. Hilary Rogers, RN, a nurse at Chattanooga, Tenn.-based Erlanger Health System, launched an initiative to give hospitalized COVID-19 patients care packages supported by community donations, local <i>NBC</i> affiliate <a href="https://www.wrcbtv.com/story/45034655/covid-care-packages-bring-morale-up-for-hospitalized-covid-patients"><i>WRCB</i></a> reported Oct. 25. The initiative started at Erlanger East Hospital in Chattanooga and has since expanded to several other hospitals in the system.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Marilyn Filter, PhD, RN, associate professor at University of Michigan-Flint's School of Nursing, and Lyn Behnke, DNP, an assistant professor of nursing at the college, <a href="https://news.umflint.edu/2021/10/19/new-device-promoting-womens-health-invented-at-um-flint/">invented</a> a new scope to make vaginal and rectal exams less invasive. The two nurses have spent the last two and one-half years developing the prototype and are now looking at starting clinical trials.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Stephanie White, RN, on Oct. 23 opened a scrub apparel shop in Chesapeake, Va., that features diverse styles of scrubs, along with other medical accessories and personal protective equipment, according to<a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/inside-business/vp-ib-scrub-appeal-1101-20211026-s4n65s33lnba3ml6t4h2wpmkpy-story.html"> Inside Business.</a></p>
