<p>Karley Yoder, general manager and chief digital officer for ultrasound at GE HealthCare, discusses the company's planned acquisition of Caption Health and why thoughtful integration is important for using AI in healthcare. The recently separated GE HealthCare division disclosed its second proposed acquisition earlier this month. It committed to buying Caption Health, a company that created guide software for ultrasound imaging that was AI-enabled. More doctors can confidently use ultrasound thanks to the guided software, according to Karley Yoder, general manager and chief digital officer for ultrasound at GE HealthCare. Healthcare has made artificial intelligence a big topic, but she points out that rather than focusing on the novelty of the technology, it's crucial to consider what it could do. "No one today discusses software as a necessary item to possess, am I correct? We're all used to hearing questions like, "What can your phone do now that it couldn't previously thanks to software?".</p>
