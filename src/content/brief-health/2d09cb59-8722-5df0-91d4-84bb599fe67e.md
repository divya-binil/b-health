<p>Diem, a new social media alternative created for women &amp; non-binary folks, is trying to answer this question.
The company came our of beta in October launching its social networking platform to a waitlist of over 20,000 people.
In a recent release the company explained that its goal is "to create digital social spaces for users to connect on common interest points, addressing the negative experiences they commonly encounter on incumbent social networks.” Focus is on community connections and authentic knowledge sharing instead of the orchestrated, performative content that dominates existing social networks today.
It has now been a few weeks since the company launched its platform to the public, so we figured it’s about time we check in with Diem Co-founder &amp; CEO Emma Bates to pick her brain about all things social networks, Web3 &amp; The Metaverse and get some insights on where her team plans to take Diem in 2022
</p><p>Diem is a place for these candid conversations to happen – somewhere where you’re not limited to the wisdom of your immediate friendship circle, instead the wisdom is infinite from folks &amp; thought-leaders around the world – our goal is to build a network of knowledgeable conversations for everyone to benefit and gain power from.
Members can discover a network of 100+ Hosts, who are thought-leaders across industries that share their wisdom with the community.
We can’t reveal too much but we believe there’s huge potential in harnessing this type of technology to create safe spaces and build places where people feel comfortable having candid conversations with each other.
men who say they game to “pass the time” – yet no 3D technology has ever really been built for the female experience (let alone marketed to us) – technology has evolved so much in the last 10+ years since Instagram &amp; Facebook’s feeds entered ourselves, so we’re excited to explore the potential for social technology that looks and feels very different from what we’re used to today.
