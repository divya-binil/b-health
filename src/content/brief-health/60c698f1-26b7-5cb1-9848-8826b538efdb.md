<p>In the face of a patient's death, a doctor reflects on the importance of doing their best and the solace they find in knowing they did everything they could, as evidenced by the gratitude of the patient's family. Mr. T stated, "I feel exhausted." A 72-year-old man named Mr. T visited our ED. He has been having reddish pee passages for the previous three days. He had an attack of bronchitis two weeks prior to this, but it was treated with ciprofloxacin rather than hospitalised. He had fully recovered. Several tests were requested by the emergency room, including a comprehensive metabolic profile and a full blood count. It had an extremely low haemoglobin level and a significant level of unconjugated bilirubin. His low haemoglobin indicated anaemia, and his elevated unconjugated bilirubin indicated the degeneration of his red blood cells. He was given the diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anaemia by the hematology-oncology team. He had begun receiving high-dose steroids and immunoglobulins.</p>
