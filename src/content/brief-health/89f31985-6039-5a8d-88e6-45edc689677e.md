    title: AKASA Inc.
    description: >-
      At AKASA we believe every dollar spent on healthcare matters, because
      healthcare matters to everyone. We believe complexity in medical billing
      and reimbursement in the United States drives up hidden costs that we all
      pay, both in terms of dollars and in the erosion of trust people have that
      our healthcare system will serve them well.


      We believe that by bringing together the best of people, data, and
      technology to address financial complexity in our healthcare system, AKASA
      serves as a powerful force for restoring trust to healthcare in the US. 


      The AKASA team came together to solve the financial failures that are
      bankrupting providers and patients across the United States. We brought
      together the best Silicon Valley technology thinkers and longtime
      healthcare industry veterans to ensure we innovate to solve the real
      challenges of healthcare revenue cycle management.
