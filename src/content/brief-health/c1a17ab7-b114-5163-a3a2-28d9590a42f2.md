At the same time, it is important to remember that some of the world’s leading companies were start-ups during previous economic downturns (GE, Microsoft, Google, Netflix, Airbnb etc). Sprinter Health CEO and Co-Founder Max Cohen offers insights on what the recession might mean for healthcare companies in particular, including his advice on the current climate for start-ups, and perspectives on the outlook for digital health. For instance, companies like Uber and Slack were started at or around the time of the 2008 recession. That&#39;s substantially lower than record-setting 2021, where digital health start-ups hauled in $29.1 billion in funding, according to Rock Health data. Cohen is optimistic about Sprinter Health&#39;s (and other home-based services providers) prospects because the company helps healthcare providers and systems bridge staffing gaps and bring the last mile of telehealth services to the home affordably.
