<p>The mobile, contactless payment process delivered by digital wallets has become increasingly popular with patients as they expect healthcare providers to deliver the consumer convenience they experience in other industries.<br>At the most basic level, a <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/what-is-a-digital-wallet/">digital wallet</a> is a digital, mobile version of patientsâ€™ financial accounts that is easily accessible via a computer or smartphone, eliminating much of the need to carry an actual wallet. Digital wallets can be used by consumers at payment terminals at in-person locations, or via apps and websites. The most common payment type examples include Apple Pay, Google Pay, Venmo and Cash App.&nbsp;</p>
