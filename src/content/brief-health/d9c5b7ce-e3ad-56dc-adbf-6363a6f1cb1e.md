<p>PointClickCare Technologies, a leading healthcare technology platform enabling meaningful collaboration and access to real‐time insights, today announced the launch of its Virtual Health offering – an integrated telemedicine solution to the Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF) market.
With the help of partner Sound Physicians, this technology is currently being implemented in more than half of the states across the U.S. Over the next two days at the AHCA/NCAL Convention and Expo, PointClickCare will be showcasing the innovative ways providers can better achieve quality care and reach the full potential of virtual health in the post‐acute setting. With PointClickCare’s Virtual Health solution, our care teams can access an on-shift physician with just one click, streamlining operations and cutting down on a lot of the administrative burdens we are faced with, all while ensuring our patients are getting the best quality of care, any time,” said Kevin Baxter, Vice President of Operations at Health Services Management.</p>
