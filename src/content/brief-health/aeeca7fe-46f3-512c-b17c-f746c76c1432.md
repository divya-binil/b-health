<p>Hospital and health system administrators are already particularly concerned about staffing shortages. Currently, a nursing degree programme adds a new dimension to the problem, According to Dani Bowie, DNP, RN, who has knowledge of staffing models. In light of the events in Florida, Dr. Bowie, vice president of clinical strategy and transformation for the San Francisco-based Trusted Health healthcare labour marketplace, advised health systems to work with state licencing boards when reviewing their current nursing staff to ensure that education degrees are legitimate and not tied to a sham university. The impact on the existing workforce situation and how many nurses are working where they are currently need a lot of administrative labour.</p>
