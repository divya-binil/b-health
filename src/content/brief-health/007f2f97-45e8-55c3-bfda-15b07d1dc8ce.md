<p>The NIH&nbsp; recently approved a 24-month grant for researchers to develop sensors that can be embedded into mobile devices which could potentially detect COVID-19 particles on their surfaces.</p><p>The General Electric Research team is set to begin developing&nbsp; miniature sensors that can be embedded into mobile devices in order to detect&nbsp;COVID-19 on their commonly used surfaces.</p><p>This project builds on past research and product development wherein the team will adapt electronic nano-sensors that are able to detect COVID-19 particles. In addition to phones, the team plans on integrating these sensors into a wide range of commonly used products and surfaces, such as tablets, smartwatches, computer keyboards and more.</p><p>“We have developed tiny sensors, smaller than a fingertip, that have the same detection capabilities as the high-end analytical instruments the size of a microwave oven,”&nbsp; Radislav Potyrailo, a principal scientist at GE Research and principal investigator on the NIH project, said in a statement. “By delivering this exquisite detection capability of a conventional high-end analytical instrument in a such a small form factor, we can now consider sensing applications that you could envision being implemented as a sensor surface on a mobile phone or on a device even smaller than that.”</p>
