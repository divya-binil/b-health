<p>When you combine this with the rising volume of inquiries or medical inquiries and patient expectations for a real-time response to every question, it becomes a perfect storm – one where life science firms opt to augment human experts in the medical information workflow with automated AI-enabled agents to breeze through the storm of data and inquiries.
Conversational AI technology allows firms to streamline systems and lessen the burden on human agents of answering repeat questions, which allows them to quickly move on to more complex concerns while providing the support and service expected in a 24 x 7 x 365 environment.
However, when researching the conversational AI option, many life science companies uncover numerous burning questions they must answer to ensure the solution will provide the right medical information and high-quality customer service.
These answers are programmed into the algorithm for AI-enabled agents to draw upon, ensuring accuracy and compliance.
Yes, there may be times that the AI-enabled agent cannot answer a question as it does not have a programmed response, or the query is posed in a complex manner.
“It sounds like you are asking for XX, is this correct?” Additionally, life sciences companies may program the AI-enabled agent to ask if the customer received the information they needed or if they would prefer to speak directly with a member of the medical information team for greater detail.
The AI-enabled agents are programmed to address questions in a specific way depending on how they are asked.
These conversations require more guidance from the AI-enabled agent in the form of additional questions.
Off-label questions by a patient will not be handled by an AI-enabled agent and they will be directed to their HCP.</p>
