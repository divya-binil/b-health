<p>Science arm of Northwell Health launches the first virtual clinical trial to reduce cardiovascular disease in the Black community.<br><br>“Cardiovascular&nbsp;disease&nbsp;is a major driver of death, particularly among people in the&nbsp;Black&nbsp;community. Understanding how to promote adherence to life-saving medications is one of the best ways we have to shrink that disparity,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/mark-butler-phd">Mark Butler, PhD</a>, an assistant investigator in the&nbsp;<a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/institute-health-system-science">Institute of Health System Science</a>&nbsp;and principal investigator on the new&nbsp;trial. “With the support of TD Bank and colleagues across the health system, we hope to determine the best intervention strategies to help people stick to their prescribed treatments and improve their&nbsp;cardiovascular&nbsp;health.”</p>
