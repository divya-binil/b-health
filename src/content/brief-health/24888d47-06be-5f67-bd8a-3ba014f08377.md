title: Tampa General, OnMed launch telehealth station that can diagnose patients
---

Busy hospital staff can't always take hours out of their day to visit a doctor about minor problems like a sinus infection or a skin rash.

Staff at Tampa General Hospital (TGH) now have a new way to access instant healthcare services via a self-contained telemedicine station located inside the hospital.

TGH partnered with Clearwater, Florida-based technology company OnMed to be the first to deploy the company's telemedicine station after six years of development. The stations feature advanced technology including thermal imaging, ultraviolet sanitization and facial recognition to operate as self-contained, unstaffed exam rooms, the company said.
