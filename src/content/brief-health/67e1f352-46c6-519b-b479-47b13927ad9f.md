<p>Healthcare is still being transformed by artificial intelligence, which now provides it with a tool that boosts efficiency and reduces costs. AI is used in a variety of ways in healthcare, including patient involvement, administrative applications, treatment decision-making, and research. The technology has enormous potential, particularly in difficult manual tasks that humans find difficult to accomplish effectively, such speeding up timelines for drug development research or finding innovative insights in huge datasets.</p><p>ChatGPT is an AI-based application that responds to user inputs with detailed, conversational text responses, which could boost healthcare productivity and cost effectiveness. ChatGPT could be used to advance telemedicine, run clinical trials, and priorities patients, among other things. Patient safety, data security, and liability are a few of the challenges that need to be resolved before ChatGPT is deployed in the healthcare system.</p>
