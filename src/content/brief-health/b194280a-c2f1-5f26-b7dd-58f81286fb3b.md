<p>An ultra-thin, lightweight electronic skin was developed by Japan researchers allowing for the remote monitoring of vital signs.</p><p>Wearable devices keep getting lighter and smarter. One of the frontrunners is electronic skin currently being developed by researchers in Japan led by Takao Someya, a professor at the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Engineering.&nbsp;</p><p>According to CNN Business, the device have been created with the ageing Japan population in mind. These groups benefit from the constant remote monitoring of their vital signs, and the e-skin would measure those and the values would be displayed in a highly visible and easy-to-understand way.&nbsp;</p><p>The electronic skin is made of polyvinyl alcohol covered with a layer of gold. This wearable sensor is attached to an individual’s chest with water spray and can be worn for a week at a time. It can measure signs such as heartbeat and electric impulses from muscle movement. Through a wireless transmitter the data is stored on a device (e.g. a smartphone) or in the cloud and can be remotely accessed by a doctor. It can potentially be used for monitoring chronic diseases like diabetes, or identify an illness symptoms early on.</p><p>&nbsp;In addition, the researchers are developing an LED display that would be worn on the back of the person’s hand to show the values, which can be a convenient format for those who have difficulties using a smartphone.</p><p>The device is yet to be assessed at clinical trials, but the researchers are already working on manufacturing processes. According to Prof Someya, e-skin being light, stretchable and durable, will soon replace today’s wearables such as watches and glasses especially considering the upcoming adoption of the 5G communication standard across the world.</p>
