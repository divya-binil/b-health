<p>The first step in a ransomware recovery strategy is ensuring that the frequency of backups increases on all data.
However, the value advantage of HDDs is only realized if the backup storage target can properly support high-density (16TB, 18TB, 20TB) hard drives without forcing the healthcare organization to suffer through a week-long recovery from media failure (RAID rebuild) times.
Maintaining this balance requires using high-density flash drives and extracting maximum performance from those drives, allowing the solution to rapidly ingest hundreds of BLI backups, maintaining them on the flash-tier for weeks, and automatically moving them to a cost-effective hard disk tier as the backup data ages.
Backup-server software is doing an excellent job of detecting ransomware, but backup storage must protect backup data from an attack.
Object storage is not known for high performance, so it wonâ€™t keep pace with the high-performance ingest requirement above, forcing the organization to potentially require two backup storage targets for their ransomware recovery strategy.</p>
