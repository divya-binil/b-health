<p>During a casual scroll through social media, I often hear the voice of my friend and fellow pediatrician warning, “Do not engage!”</p><p>Generally speaking, this is almost always the correct advice. The rise of various social media platforms, the ability to rapidly share information and disinformation, the growing culture of doing one’s own “research,” and the apparent difficulty in separating reputable from non-reputable sources online has created the perfect storm. In medicine, especially in my field of pediatrics, half-truths, and untruths can be incredibly dangerous. While my fellow physicians and I are on social media as moms, dads, daughters, sons, wives, husbands, sisters, brothers, friends, and neighbors—sharing milestones and soliciting advice about daycares, home décor, good eats, and the like—we have also taken an oath to do no harm. Our identity as physicians is inextricably linked to our identity as human beings. And while the line is clear in the office or hospital setting, where our patients come to us for our guidance and expertise, it is notably blurred outside of this environment.</p>
