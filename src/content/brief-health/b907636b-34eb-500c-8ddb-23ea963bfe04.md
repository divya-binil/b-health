<p>Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano today announced the City’s new partnership with<a href="https://gobloominghealth.com/">&nbsp;Blooming Health</a>, a platform that better connects the Yonkers Office for the Aging with Yonkers’ Seniors through email, text message, and phone services. Using Blooming Health’s services, information will be better communicated to older adults so those who require it will receive assistance, transportation services, health monitoring, and more to stay physically and mentally active.</p><p>“The pandemic highlighted the urgency to get information out to our communities quickly and efficiently,”&nbsp;<strong>said Mayor Mike Spano. “</strong>While Yonkers successfully worked to streamline pertinent communication to our residents, we realize there is always room for improvement to better the quality of life for communities, including our aging population. Thanks to the partnership with Blooming Health, we will better connect with our seniors to ensure there is no gap in communication.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.yonkersny.gov/home">The City of Yonkers</a>&nbsp;piloted Blooming Health’s services in 2021 with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yonkersny.gov/government/departments/office-for-the-aging/yonkers-neighborhood-naturally-occurring-retirement-community-nnorc">Yonkers Neighborhood Naturally Occurring Retirement Community</a>&nbsp;(NNORC). During the pilot period, the NNORC used Blooming Health to send members personalized reminders for activities and events and broadcast messages for important announcements such as vaccine and testing clinics and class cancellations. Older adults using Blooming Health attended 1.9 times more events than non-Blooming Health users. The results uncovered that 87% of older adults reported a positive experience with Blooming Health and 78% of older adults would recommend the service to others.</p><p><strong>Kelly Chiarella, Director of the Office for the Aging stated,</strong>&nbsp;“Our older residents run the gamut in terms of technological capabilities. Offering communication about our programs by email, text, or phone call and in many languages captures everyone. We are excited to be able to expand our outreach through Blooming Health in a meaningful way with data-driven analytics to make strategic decisions about social programming.”</p><p><strong>Nima Roohi, Ph.D., CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Blooming Health commented,</strong>&nbsp;“Blooming Health is honored to be trusted by the Yonkers Office for the Aging to empower the city’s older adults to age in the place comfortably and enjoyably. We look forward to expanding our partnership with the City of Yonkers and being a part of their mission to make Yonkers one of the best cities to age in.”</p><p>After a successful pilot, the City of Yonkers Senior Services will be expanding the use of Blooming Health’s services to the Home Delivered Meals, Transportation, and Senior Housing programs.</p><p>To learn more about Blooming Health, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gobloominghealth.com/">www.gobloominghealth.com</a>&nbsp;or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:team@gobloominghealth.com">team@gobloominghealth.com</a>.</p><p><strong>About Blooming Health</strong><br>Founded in 2020 by Nima Roohi, Ph.D., Kavitha Gnanasambandan, Ph.D., and Naman Gupta, Blooming Health partners with aging service providers (ASPs)&nbsp; to enable healthy aging-in-place for the older adult population. ASPs use Blooming Health’s self-service web application to communicate with their members via one-click broadcasts, wellness check-ins, gamified engagement, interest-based program reminders, and more. Older adults receive these communications through the low-tech channels that they rely on: text messages, voice calls, and email. Blooming Health offers many languages other than English such as Spanish, Chinese, and Hebrew.</p><p>At&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gobloominghealth.com/">Blooming Health</a>, the organization enables healthy aging-in-place for vulnerable older adults by better connecting them to community-based social and healthcare support.&nbsp;They help community-based aging service providers remotely engage with older adults about their social and day-to-day needs in an inclusive way (via text, voice calls, emails and in multiple languages).&nbsp;They have a growing network of 12+ Aging Service Providers, who serve 80,000+ older adults, using its solution across New York.</p>
