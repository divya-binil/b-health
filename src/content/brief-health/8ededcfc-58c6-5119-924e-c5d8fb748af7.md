<p>In our ongoing effort to offer the best possible patient care, the complexities of health care management present a persistent challenge. The prior authorization (PA) process, which frequently places a large administrative and resource load on doctors and medical staff, is a major barrier. The recent CNN report on UnitedHealthcare's decision to switch from prior permission to advance notification for endoscopic services including colonoscopies makes note of this. There is an urgent need for intelligent automation in the PA process because to the inefficiencies of the manual approach, which are emphasized by refused claims because of insufficient paperwork and scattered information across systems. The necessity of automation in the current environment. The burden on healthcare organisations is growing as a result of a regulatory environment that is ever more complicated and persistent staff shortages.</p>
