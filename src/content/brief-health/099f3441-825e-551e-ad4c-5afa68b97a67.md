<p><a href="https://hitconsultant.net/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-reveals-the-need-for-a-broader-digital-front-door/">Coronavirus</a> is a deadly virus with a high transmission rate. It has become so widespread that it has now disrupted the economies of every country on the planet. Since it is a novel virus, there are still tons about it that we do not know.&nbsp;</p><p>However, one thing rings true—the health and safety of the general public is of utmost importance. Who is at the helm of all this? All the medical frontline workers who are risking their lives to contain the virus and treat all patients.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the reality is grimmer for most, as many families now have to deal with the coronavirus’s effects. Some are lucky to recover, while others are unfortunate to succumb to the effects.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Reality On the Ground</strong></p><p>As of writing, the U.S. already <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/">recorded</a> close to 105,000 total deaths. With more than 1.7 million coronavirus cases in the U.S., hospitals are now seeing a massive influx of patients to the point that they are already rejecting them for treatment. This is being done simply because their facility and their doctors can no longer attend to them.&nbsp;</p>
