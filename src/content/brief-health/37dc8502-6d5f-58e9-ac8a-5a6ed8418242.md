<p>In the past, Allegheny Health Network Chief Operations Officer Duke Rupert says he didn't necessarily think of cybersecurity as his purview.
"Quite frankly, [the risk] has become more evident … every single day," he said during a session at the HIMSS Healthcare Cybersecurity Forum this week.
"From my perspective, everything centers around the patient," Rupert said.
Sah explained that the team at Centura Health also considers cyber risk from business-operations and patient-care perspectives, among other factors.</p>
