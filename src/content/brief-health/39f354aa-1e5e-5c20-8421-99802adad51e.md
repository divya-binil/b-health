<p>It includes an AI support tool for analysing mammograms and a neuroscience technology for reducing stress and improving sleep quality.
New healthcare technologies are set to be tested in partnership with the public healthcare clusters in Singapore for potential future adoption and large-scale implementation.
For the first time in its second year, the event saw all three public healthcare clusters in Singapore - National Healthcare Group (NHG), National University Health System (NUHS) and Singapore Health Services (SingHealth) â€“ work together to assess the feasibility of proposed projects.
NuCalm (partnered with SingHealth) - neuroscience-based technology that is clinically proven to reduce stress and improve sleep quality.</p>
