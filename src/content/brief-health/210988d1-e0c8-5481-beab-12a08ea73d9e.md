<p>According to patient experience study published earlier this month, the majority of Americans are currently not enjoying fantastic healthcare experiences, and the majority have had outright negative encounters. According to the most current findings from The Beryl Institute - Ipsos PX Pulse, 76% of Americans asked stated they had a terrible patient experience in the previous three months, and 60% indicated they had an egregiously bad healthcare encounter. According to Jason Wolf, president and CEO of The Beryl Institute, these findings might be indicative of the status of the healthcare system right now. People's perceptions of their experiences in healthcare are significantly impacted by the enormous pressures the healthcare system is currently under, according to Wolf. Longer wait periods, access problems, and understaffed units that impede response time are also factors.</p>
