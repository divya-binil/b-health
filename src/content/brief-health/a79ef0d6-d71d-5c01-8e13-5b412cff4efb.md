      SymphonyCare is now WellStack. Why did we change our name? We felt
      WellStack is a better representation of our team's passion. WellStack
      combines wellness + technology stack and conveys our commitment to
      improving clinical outcomes for patients and populations and the overall
      financial stability of our healthcare organization partners.

      ecosystem that creates a single source of truth necessary for

      WellStack democratizes healthcare data and accelerates analytics by
      providing multi-channel data access to decision-makers, analysts, and
      researchers with varying technical skills. This strategy helps
      organizations maximize resource utilization by simplifying report
      development and analysis, resulting in a jumpstart on their data science
      journey with the flexibility to innovate and scale to meet future demands.
