<p>The InterOrtho Research Group aims to develop an entirely new research area of improved patient care through advanced sensor technologies.<br><br>The InterOrtho Research Group at Aalborg University Hospital in Denmark aims to develop an entirely new research area of improved patient care through advanced sensor technologies.
The InterOrtho Research Group at Aalborg University Hospital in Denmark is developing a novel research area of improved patient care via advanced sensor technologies.
Today, the planning of outpatient check-ups is based on historic data from large patient populations, which reflects the expected development of the type of surgery in question.
The orthopaedic surgery research group InterOrtho, at Aalborg University Hospital, develops and validates modern technology based on sensors that can continuously collect data about patients while they are at home, independent of the planned checks at the hospital.
These are primarily developed for leisure exercisers (running, walking, strength training, etc.), and it is therefore not given that the same technologies are able to provide valid data in patients who have had surgery on the hip or knee.</p>
