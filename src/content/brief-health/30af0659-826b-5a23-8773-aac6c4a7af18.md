<p>Music was elemental throughout human history. It connects humans with each other, at the same time it helps you relax or focus.<br><br>We tend to think that we know how our brain works. We believe that art and creativity (thus, music, too) belong to the right hemisphere of it and math, logic, linear thinking and facts to the left. Interestingly, as Daniel J. Levitin explains in his book, <a href="http://daniellevitin.com/publicpage/books/this-is-your-brain-on-music/">“This Is Your Brain on Music”</a>, music is processed <i>throughout</i> the brain. Maybe that is why music has been elemental throughout human history: it can connect people with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>So when the first lockdown began worldwide, we all started to look for things to do at home, to eliminate the feeling of disconnectedness. One choice, watching movies, was obvious – and so the streaming wars have begun. Ever since, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2020/03/24/netflix-traffic-hits-all-time-highs-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-says-att/?sh=3a814e0b3adc">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/12/hbo-max-streaming-12-6-million-subscribers-att-ceo-john-stankey-the-undoing-1234652083/">HBO Max</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielshapiro/2020/03/23/exclusive-disney-sees-huge-subscription-spike-as-homebound-audiences-clamor-for-content/#298bb44817c4">Disney+</a> and the rest have been ruling the space, giving an unprecedented boost to at-home watching. But another area has also achieved tremendous growth: music downloads.&nbsp;</p>
