<p>The prevalence of chronic disease in the United States will increase over the next several decades among all age groups, as will the associated care costs, and physical, mental and social consequences. Major obstacles to effective chronic care management (CCM) include:</p><p>– Patients rarely suffer from a single chronic condition at the time of their diagnosis1. They are given multiple prescriptions and treatments with differing instructions and guidance, which is overwhelming and can lead to confusion and non-adherence2.</p><p>– The number of patients seeking access to care and an ongoing healthcare provider shortage. In some areas it may take four to six months for a patient to schedule a routine appointment with their primary care provider or specialist.</p><p>Our healthcare system has largely been ineffective in managing chronic diseases to date, and now reimbursement changes are shifting the burden of chronic care management to the physician. Addressing this patient population will require a different approach since their conditions are typically the result of lifestyle choices. The solution will require a shift in focus from treatment to prevention, and leverage advanced technology to improve outcomes.</p>
