<p>eHealth Exchange today announced that CRISP Shared Services, which provides health information exchange (HIE) and health data utility infrastructure for five statewide non-profit HIE organizations, intends to be the first participant in eHealth Exchange’s anticipated Qualified Health Information Network (QHIN).
When the application period opens this fall, eHealth Exchange is ideally suited to be among the nation’s first QHINs. The network has 13 years of experience supporting large-scale health information exchange across a network of diverse participants, including 64 regional and state HIEs. This experience includes supporting more than 30 different electronic medical record technologies.
The eHealth Exchange, a 501(c)3 non-profit, is among the oldest and largest health information networks in America and is most well-known as the principal way the federal government shares data between agencies and with the private sector.
CRISP Shared Services (CSS) is a non-profit support organization that provides technology infrastructure and other core services to health information exchanges (HIEs) across the United States.</p>
