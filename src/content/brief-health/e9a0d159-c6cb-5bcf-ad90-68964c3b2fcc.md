<p>We are witnessing a race in the vaccine rollout. A race towards the light at the end of a tunnel and a race which will likely define the next few years, according to Dr Charles Alessi, chief clinical officer at HIMSS.<br><br>This is a race between nations to see who is the first to emerge from the horrors of the COVID-19 second or third waves.&nbsp;</p><p>The advantages of becoming able to break free from lockdown are enormous.&nbsp;Not only to the “captive populations”, but also economically as countries start to get to grips with&nbsp;the enormous damage this pandemic has wreaked on their economies.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Who are the riders and runners in Europe, the Middle East and Africa?</strong></h3><p>Israel is clearly in the lead.&nbsp;Approximately 30 doses&nbsp;per 100&nbsp;people of the&nbsp;population have been vaccinated as I write this and this is an extraordinary achievement. Although it is not exactly typical of its peers with a small (9.2 million) population in a small geography, in many respects Israel has become the laboratory for the world. They also enjoy excellent digital infrastructure and have the capacity to mobilise their population quickly.&nbsp;They have already vaccinated more than seven eighths&nbsp;of the over 60s.&nbsp;The effect of this on the number of 60-year-olds and above in intensive care should be discernible&nbsp;over the next few weeks, when according to the Weizmann institute this will translate into a halving of their number in critical care and if we extrapolate further,&nbsp;most COVID-related deaths will have disappeared in Israel by the Easter in early April.&nbsp;</p>
