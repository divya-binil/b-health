<p>iRhythm Technologies announced it has received another FDA 510(k) clearance for its ZEUS (Zio ECG Utilization Software) System that works with a wearable to monitor patients with atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm. Developed in partnership with Alphabet life science subsidiary Verily, the ZEUS System is a platform that works with the Zio Watch to detect AFib, characterize the amount of AFib a patient is experiencing and integrate with a clinician's workflow.
iRhythm chief technology officer Mark Day told MobiHealthNews the latest clearance is for an algorithm that offers context on how much AFib the patient is experiencing over time.</p>
