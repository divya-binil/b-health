<p>Through the DeliverHealth Platform, which creates simpler ways to document, code and reach patients digitally, physicians can now use their existing, expanded and other interpretation services on mobile devices with the press of a button.
We are committed to giving clinicians and physicians a mobile-first way to improve the way they deliver care with a solution that clearly demonstrates a commitment to health equity while also removing one more frustrating, costly and burnout-inducing burden providers confront daily.
DeliverHealth, a global provider of technology-enabled solutions for hospitals, health systems and group practices, announced the official unveiling of its Language Access workflow tool, designed to improve existing connections between physicians and limited English proficient (LEP) patients, enhance compliance and reimbursement, and boost both provider and patient satisfaction.
</p><p>“We are committed to giving clinicians and physicians a mobile-first way to improve the way they deliver care with a solution that clearly demonstrates a commitment to health equity while also removing one more frustrating, costly and burnout-inducing burden providers confront daily.”
Language Access, one of the newest mobile capabilities introduced within the DeliverHealth Platform, integrates within the electronic health record (EHR) to give clinicians, physicians and care teams the language interpreter tool they need to improve care and outcomes for the country’s more than 25 million U.S. LEP patients.
“We are creating an ecosystem of capabilities within the DeliverHealth Platform to give clinicians and physicians convenient, simple ways to document, code, and communicate with patients in the patient’s preferred way,” said Jason Martin, Chief Product Officer, Provider Solutions at DeliverHealth.
The DeliverHealth Platform applies purpose-built artificial intelligence to clear the way for the healthcare connections that matter most, removing complexities from within health systems and helping to solve systemic issues like physician burnout, the connected patient journey, and the transition to digital health.</p>
