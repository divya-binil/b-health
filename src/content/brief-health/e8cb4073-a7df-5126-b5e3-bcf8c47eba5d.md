<p>Savvy Cooperative, a patient-owned public benefit co-op that provides patient insights, and ProofPilot, the digital protocol automation platform for clinical trials, have teamed up to develop a turnkey model for clinical trial sponsors to pressure test protocol designs with Savvy Cooperative patients through ProofPilot's digital protocol interface. According to Chris Venezia, Chief Executive Officer of ProofPilot, "Patients are vital to the success of clinical trials, yet research procedures are frequently established without ever considering the patient experience before commencing a study." "Our collaboration with Savvy Cooperative will establish a new industry benchmark for sponsors to engage patients, enhancing their clinical trial experience and eventually producing data of higher quality for industry-sponsored research," says the company. Some pharmaceutical corporations in recent years have actively involved patients in the design phase.</p>
