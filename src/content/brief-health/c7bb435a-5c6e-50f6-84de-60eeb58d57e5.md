<p><a href="https://cotahealthcare.com/">COTA, Inc.,</a> an oncology real-world data and analytics company, announced insights from a study of practicing oncologists that reveals 83 percent of oncologists surveyed believe real-world data is critical to accelerating the development of potentially life-saving cancer drugs and treatments. The study, which was conducted by independent research firm PureSpectrum and COTA, analyzed 200 practicing oncologistsâ€™ perceptions on a number of issues related to cancer research and <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/clinical-trials/">clinical trials,</a> including: diversity, the use of real-world data (RWD), and the effect that the lightning-quick COVID-19 vaccine development process had on patient expectations.</p><p>The study found that oncologists believe it is important for all clinical trials to include a real-world data component, and the overwhelming majority (78 percent) would urge pharmaceutical companies and cancer research groups to use real-world data in all clinical trials as well. Additionally, 71 percent stated that they believe real-world data, when used as an external control arm, can make a clinical trial more efficient and representative.</p>
