<p>Those of you who follow The Medical Futurist channels closely know how much we support digital health technology. It is not without a reason – and it’s not the technology itself, but the fact that digital health technologies add to the advancement of medicine altogether. They directly contribute to the innovation in medicine, and hence, the wellbeing of patients.&nbsp;</p><p>Technological progress has helped humanity eradicate diseases, fight poverty and starvation, and, more recently, it is helping us to cope with a deadly pandemic. At The Medical Futurist, we envision a future where doctors and patients work together on an equal level for better health, using technology as a platform to elevate the quality of care.</p><p>In order to bring <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/our-vision">our vision</a> to make it a reality today, we need to disseminate this idea widely, and from time to time we need to revisit where we stand.</p><p>This article serves this very purpose.</p>
