<p>Mike Sicilia, EVP of Oracle Global Industries, describes what the company has been prioritizing since the Cerner acquisition finalized this past June, and previews what it will be showcasing on the HIMSS23 exhibit floor in Chicago this month.</p><p>Going into next week's 2023 HIMSS Global Health Conference &amp; Exhibition, the most important healthcare trend for the Big Tech company is the human element. The company knows physicians and staff are burned out. This was a problem before the pandemic, and that crisis put a fine point on it.</p><p>When they’re burned out, quality of care suffers, and good people leave the field altogether, the company cautions.</p><p>"We can’t solve the whole problem, but we can and should work on ways to address one of the key drivers of physician and staff burnout – the administrative burden that is a constant source of complaints," said Mike Sicilia, executive vice president, Oracle Global Industries. "By alleviating that burden, we can reduce attrition and increase the amount of time physicians and staff are free to do what they’re best at, which is taking care of people."<br><br><a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/oracle-health-tees-innovations-interoperability-burnout-and-more-himss23">Read on healthcareitnews.com</a></p>
