<p>Ribbon Health, an API data platform for the healthcare industry that powers care decisions, and Turquoise Health, a provider of structured data on the cost of care to make pricing data both transparent and accessible to patients, announced an integration partnership.
By integrating Turquoise Health’s price transparency data into the Ribbon Health platform, healthcare companies will be able to effectively navigate patients to cost-effective and high-quality care.
By partnering with Turquoise Health, we aim to help payers, providers, and digital health companies access the price transparency data they need to better patients’ experiences when making care decisions.
Turquoise Health’s price transparency data unlocks another layer of granularity for patients, enabling them to make healthcare decisions based on more comprehensive information.</p>
