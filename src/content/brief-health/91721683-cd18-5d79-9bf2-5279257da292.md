<p>Virtual primary care understands a patient's needs over time and helps them navigate to the right care – whether for urgent needs, a wellness visit, or specialty care. Health plans leveraging virtual primary care, he continues, can better close gaps in care, lower costs, deliver better clinical outcomes and expand access to care.
Those who engage with primary care identify their health issues earlier and more effectively, have better medication adherence, enjoy better chronic disease management, and ultimately gain better health outcomes.
It offers primary care through a continuous relationship with a dedicated primary care physician and care team, where patients benefit from virtual access to 24/7 urgent care, prevention, screening and ongoing condition management in one experience that is convenient and highly personalized. Virtual primary care embedded in a virtual-first health plan offers a novel alternative for employers and health plans to lower costs while at the same time improve outcomes and member engagement.
The healthcare ecosystem is evolving, and it's clear that improving health outcomes will require considering the centrality of virtual solutions in plan design as an opportunity to address consumers' needs and transform the quality of primary care.</p>
