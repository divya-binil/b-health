<p>A new AKASA survey highlights the vacant roles healthcare CFOs and financial leaders most need talent for to sustain daily operations within medical billing and the revenue cycle.
The survey of more than 400 healthcare financial leaders ranked the following as the roles where they have the greatest need to fill vacancies: 
It’s challenging to find the time and resources required to train and upskill revenue cycle specialists currently on staff.
When there’s a demand, revenue cycle specialists are hired.
This reactionary hiring cycle results in permanent workers often facing too much work, and patients having a less-than-stellar financial experience.”</p>
