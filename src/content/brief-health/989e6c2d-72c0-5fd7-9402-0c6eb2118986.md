<p>Innovative medtech companies face a range of challenges getting their products into hospitals and clinics – and it isn’t just paperwork.
David Jayne, professor of surgery at the University of Leeds’ Centre for Healthcare Innovation, said clinicians and innovators had to learn to talk to each other in order to speed development and delivery of new products.
Deeper understanding might help, but effective innovation needed still more, said Graeme Hall, executive chairman of Brandon Medical.
Innovators also faced challenges in getting funding in timely fashion, said Chris Yates, chief executive of Abingdon Health, which makes lateral flow tests.
“That’s a whole cycle of innovation,” he said.
We can help them get their products up and running and get those innovations into the market.</p>
