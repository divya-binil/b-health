<p>Digital health leaders are applying lessons learned about what has worked during successive phases of the pandemic to their strategies for patient engagement going forward. Leaders from SCL Health, Boston Children’s Hospital and UPMC Enterprises shared their thoughts during a recent webinar.</p><p>Mona Baset is vice president of digital services at&nbsp;Colorado-based SCL Health, which has eight hospitals and 150 physician clinics mainly in Colorado and Montana. She said that to meet the information-sharing needs of both patients and employees during the pandemic, the nonprofit SCL Health relied on the digital health foundation it had already established.</p><p>&nbsp;“What really guided us throughout this is a set of digital guiding principles that we used with our work, even before the pandemic,” Baset said. “We were able to test these principles out and found that they were very sound. It involves making experiences easy and low effort — don't put friction into your processes, make it as easy as possible. And then really focus on the user and their needs, not our own processes. We all have very complex processes in the background. Let's keep those behind the scenes and give users what information they need to do their tasks effectively and quickly.”</p>
