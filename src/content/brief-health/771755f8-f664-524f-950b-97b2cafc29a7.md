<p>The patented technology builds upon Medicomp's existing patent for intelligent filtering of health-related information that enables a clinician user to not only see all relevant clinical data for a patient's physical problem, but to also be presented with the clinical protocols for that problem.
This patent, the latest of four recent patents awarded to Medicomp, forms the core of the company's Quippe solutions, which support clinicians at the point of care by giving them the information they want to see, when they want to see it, and without slowing them down or impeding workflows.
"As the industry moves to a more data-centric approach to healthcare, it is critical for systems to bring together all relevant clinical information for a patient at the point of care, organized in the way that clinicians think and work, without requiring them to search for it, or to go back later and address outstanding issues," said Jay Anders, MD, chief medical officer of Medicomp.
</p><p>The patent covers the method of receiving clinical data, including items encoded in external standard terminologies and code sets, converting the data into clinical concepts included in Medicomp's clinical relevancy engine, and using the relevancy rankings to filter and present the incoming data to the clinician at the point of care.
MEDCIN is Medicomp's unique clinical relevancy engine that includes an intelligent clinical database to support accurate documentation and prompting of relevant information at the point of care.
For more than 40 years, Medicomp has worked with physicians from leading medical centers and institutions to create solutions that work seamlessly with any EHR to deliver diagnostically relevant and actionable information to clinicians at the point of care.</p>
