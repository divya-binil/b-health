<p>"The company is focused on efficiently growing its core prescriptions business, accelerating its pharma manufacturer solutions business and doubling down on consumer engagement," Karsten Voermann, GoodRx's chief financial officer, wrote in the SEC filing.
During its second quarter earnings call, GoodRx said it was focusing on developing new services and incentives to ensure users would create accounts on their platform, which it doesn't require to provide a "frictionless" experience. GoodRx's announcement marks the latest in a line of digital health and health tech companies that have laid off workers this summer.</p>
