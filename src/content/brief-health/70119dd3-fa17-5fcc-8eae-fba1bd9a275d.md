<p>The advantages of telehealth beyond enabling physician/patient relationships to continue virtually are now driving adoption in many aspects of care provision that were critically disrupted by the pandemic - most notably preventive healthcare, remote patient monitoring and chronic disease management.
With chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease on the rise, particularly among ageing populations, the digital collection and monitoring of data is one of the main ways in which physicians can build more complete pictures of their patientsâ€™ health.
The use of remote monitoring devices in this rapidly evolving landscape can help to increase diagnosis the diagnosis rate, and to streamline treatment and care for a range of chronic conditions.
Sky Labs CEO Jack Lee says: "It will help patients with chronic disease to manage various conditions including heart failure, help manage the entire chronic disease cycle from screening to diagnosis to follow-up, and also allow us to accurately collect data in increasingly large-scale decentralised trials."</p>
