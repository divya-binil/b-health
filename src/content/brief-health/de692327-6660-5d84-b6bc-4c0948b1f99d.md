<p>One of Germany’s key digital health strategies is to improve hospital scores on DigitalRadar, according to a recently unveiled Digitisation Strategy for Health and Care by Germany's Federal Ministry of Health. DigitalRadar is a digital maturity model established by the ministry in partnership with HIMSS and other research and advisory partners. According to the strategy, 50% of all hospitals receiving funding from the Hospital Future Fund will have reached a higher level of digital maturity in at least two categories of the DigitalRadar standard by the end of 2025. No other nation has a database as extensive as this one on how digitised its hospital system is. A financial tool addressed by the Recovery and Resilience Facility's national plan is the Hospital Future Fund. Early evaluations by DigitalRadar positioned Germany's hospitals in the middle of the pack on the international stage. More than 1,500 German hospitals conducted a study of their level of digital maturity. They discovered that while patient participation and telemedicine showed the most room for growth, they scored the best on structures and systems.</p>
