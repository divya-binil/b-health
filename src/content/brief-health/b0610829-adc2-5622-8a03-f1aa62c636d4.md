<p>The country's FinnGen Project seeks to use its unique population bottleneck and cohesive health records to drive genetic insights.<br><br>Deep in the belly of the University of Helsinki, large metallic cylinders line a basement lab. While the setting is clinical, scientists have added a playful touch with&nbsp;snow-themed name tags on each of the vats. Still, the mission of the lab is serious — inside “snow queen” and “snow castle” lie genetic samples that could potentially help decode genetic variants responsible for disease.</p><p><strong>Finland is unique&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Finland came onto the world stage last year when it was named <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/duncanmadden/2018/03/27/ranked-the-10-happiest-countries-in-the-world-in-2018/#51cc32e573e9"><strong>“happiest country”</strong></a> by Forbes.
