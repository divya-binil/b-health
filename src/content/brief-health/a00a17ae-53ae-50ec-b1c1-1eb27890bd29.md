<p>With Google Health and Apple both reported to be, respectively, closing down and scaling back their healthcare efforts, it's worth asking just how disruptive consumer technology companies can be in this hugely complex and fragmented industry.<br><br>When David Feinberg, head of Google Health, announced this past week that he was departing to <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/cerner-names-dr-david-feinberg-president-and-ceo">take up the CEO role at the EHR company Cerner</a>, media reports took it as an admission of defeat by Google in the campaign to win in the healthcare space.</p><p>A leaked internal memo, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-health-shutting-down-david-feinberg-leaves-2021-8">scooped</a> by Business Insider, revealed that the Google Health division was disbanding. The parts are scattered among different business units where they may simply limp along or quietly shut down.</p><p>Google wasn't alone in making news. Another <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-scaling-back-healthhabit-app-layoffs-2021-8">article</a> in the same week&nbsp;in&nbsp;Business Insider&nbsp;revealed that Apple acknowledged it is "<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-scaling-back-healthhabit-app-layoffs-2021-8">scaling back</a>" a key project, an app called Health Habit.</p><p>The app allows Apple employees to <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/apple-scaling-back-employees-only-virtual-care-app-says-insider">log fitness goals, manage hypertension, and talk to clinicians and coaches</a> at AC Wellness, the doctors' group that Apple works with.</p><p>There was no shortage of commentary on social media. Aaron Martin, chief digital officer of Providence, quipped on LinkedIn: "If you're a big tech and want to exit healthcare, this is the week to do it." For good measure, he added the hashtag #healthcareishard.</p>
