<p>This year and the coronavirus pandemic brought new challenges to hospitals and healthcare facilities across the globe. And while the first phase of vaccine distribution has put a light at the end of the tunnel, many regions are still handling surging cases as a result of the holiday season.&nbsp;</p><p>As we navigate combatting the latest surge and distributing the first rounds of the vaccine, hospital and healthcare system leaders should use lessons learned from this year to ensure the doctors, nurses, administrative staff, and others who work in their facilities are informed, feel protected, and understand the steps being taken to promote safety within their workplace.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking beyond the<a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/coronavirus-covid-19/"> COVID-19 pandemic</a>, conversations about workplace safety in hospitals aren’t going anywhere. Workplace violence is <a href="https://nam05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2Fsections%2Fhealth-shots%2F2019%2F04%2F08%2F709470502%2Ffacing-escalating-workplace-violence-hospitals-employees-have-had-enough&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C69614aae1c994234bd4f08d74e8b19f5%7Cbf0b48c768944eb6bf538621676ccee4%7C0%7C0%7C637064231679287795&amp;sdata=Vnr6DcfDDrTfN%2FoaKTJQXTXeJ0gSX0ZG7VYOGpKyq1U%3D&amp;reserved=0">four times</a> more likely to occur&nbsp;in a healthcare setting than in other industries, and 96% of male nurses and 85% of female nurses have been physically threatened by their own patients. With this in mind, hospitals and healthcare facilities can leverage technology to ensure the doctors, nurses, and other staff who provide lifesaving care have a safe and sustainable work environment whether faced with day-to-day issues like workplace violence or global disruptions impacting virtually every hospital like the pandemic.</p>
