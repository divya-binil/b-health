<p>The non-profit healthcare network is funding the creation of vocal biomarker technologies to check for anxiety and cognitive disorders through its Bear's Den innovation accelerator programme.</p><p>The health institution Hackensack Meridian Health has partnered with Canary Health, which analyses digital indicators in the human voice to explain or forecast health-related events using proprietary machine learning modelling. As a result, Hackensack Meridien will be able to advance its wellness-related artificial intelligence technology. According to the announcement made on Thursday, Canary Speech's patented technology measures health parameters "quickly, non-invasively, and accurately." Canary Speech, created by the speech AI and neurology team behind Amazon Alexa, seeks to offer proactive screening in real time using algorithms designed to supplement standardized clinical tests like the GAD7 for anxiety and the PHQ8 for depression.</p>
