<p>Ordr, the leader in connected device security, today announced Ordr Clinical Defender 8.1, providing Healthcare Technology Management (HTM) teams a full-lifecycle vulnerability management platform to more efficiently prioritize and address risks for their connected medical devices.
With the 8.1 release, Ordr Clinical Defender optimizes the process of managing medical devices and their vulnerabilities.
"Ordr Clinical Defender allows each user to focus on the specific devices they're responsible for, from a single screen, and helps them understand, prioritize and manage vulnerability workflows based on full business context.
The Clinical Defender 8.1 release also adds the Ordr Software Inventory Collector, and integration with Crowdstrike and Crowdstrike Humio to ensure HTM teams have comprehensive device and operating system visibility at their fingertips.
"With the enhancements in Ordr Clinical Defender 8.1, HTM teams will now be able to manage the complete vulnerability lifecycle for all clinical devices.
</p><p>"Ordr Clinical Defender has been an invaluable tool to help our clinical engineering teams improve the management and security of our IoMT devices," said Dave Yaeger, Biomed Security DBA for ProHealth Care.
"The advancements in the latest release support our whole hospital security approach across the healthcare system and will evolve the way our clinical engineering and security teams work together to manage device vulnerabilities and risks."
Risk reduction through Full-Lifecycle Vulnerability Management - Ordr simplifies how healthcare delivery organizations manage the complete vulnerability lifecycle for connected healthcare devices.
 Collaboration with security teams - Ordr now integrates with Humio, Crowdstrike's scalable log management platform, sharing medical device context to facilitate better collaboration with security teams. Simplify how device context is gathered - Ordr Software Inventory Collector simplifies how device context, including vulnerabilities, can be gathered for all managed and unmanaged devices on all leading operating systems, no matter where and how the devices and users connect.</p>
