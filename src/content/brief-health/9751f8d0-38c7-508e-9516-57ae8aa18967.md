<p>The future of medical tools needs to be catalytic as opposed to a hindrance. We explore NUI as future tools in healthcare interfaces<br><br>Tools we use to do our daily work have rapidly evolved following deep human-computer interaction (HCI) research.&nbsp; However, when it comes to healthcare, the HCI research has not found its way to healthcare practice. Most healthcare professionals still rely on memory, experience, pen &amp; paper and difficult-to-use healthcare software. The future of medical tools needs to be catalytic as opposed to a hindrance. In this piece, we attempt to untangle the set of tools used in healthcare today and its natural evolution.</p>
