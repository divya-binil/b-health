<p>The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in drug discovery is expanding. Researchers at the University of Zurich (UZH) have now been able to better understand a significant metabolic disorder because to advancements in the use of Big Data, learning algorithms, and powerful computers.</p><p>The worldwide prevalence of cystinosis, a rare lyosomal storage condition, ranges from 1 in 100,000 to 200,000 infants. The most prevalent and serious type of cystinosis, nephropathic (non-inflammatory), begins to show signs of kidney disease in the first few months of infancy and frequently results in renal failure by the age of ten. According to Olivier Devuyst, co-director of the ITINERARE University Research Centre and leader of the Mechanisms of Inherited Kidney Disorders (MIKADO) group, "Children with cystinosis suffer from a devastating, multisystemic disease, and there are currently no available curative treatments."</p>
