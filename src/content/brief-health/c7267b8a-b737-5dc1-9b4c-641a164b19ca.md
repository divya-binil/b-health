<p>Those with a passion both for technology and for helping others might consider a career in healthcare technology, and as the industry continues its widespread digital transformation, there will be plenty of roles to fill. Although technology has been significantly influencing the healthcare sector for some time, the pandemic made its effects more apparent. Technology tools not only aided in the quick creation of vaccinations but also allowed patients to communicate with doctors without travelling, assisted local healthcare providers in exchanging crucial knowledge and data regarding the spread of Covid-19, and more. Healthcare technology is a field that those with a passion for both helping people and technology might want to investigate. As the sector continues its extensive digital transformation, there will be a large number of open positions. A few of the tech-forward roles and tasks that will soon be present in healthcare organisations to aid medical practitioners in providing the finest treatment are described here by 16 members of Forbes Technology Council.</p>
