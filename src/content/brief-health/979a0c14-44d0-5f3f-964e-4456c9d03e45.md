<p>More than 80% of patients prefer this in-depth style of telemedicine to in-person care, says the health system's CMIO. Baptist Health, a health system situated in Louisville, Kentucky, that services Kentucky and Indiana, reviewed some of its outcomes, including desire to make more video visits in the future, after the near emergency ramp-up of video visits across the company when the COVID-19 epidemic struck. One of the difficulties was the lack of a thorough physical examination. While a video visit with observation and asking the patient to complete specific tests can reveal quite a bit, the Baptist team was searching for a tool that would offer more. According to Dr. Brett A., "We intended to close this gap so that we could go forward with alternative care models that offer excellent patient experiences, are high quality, convenient, and cost less."</p>
