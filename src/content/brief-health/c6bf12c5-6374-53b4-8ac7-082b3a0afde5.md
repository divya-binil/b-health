<p>Participants in HealthTech Build's recent panel discuss the barriers to adoption for digital therapeutics.<br><br>Unlike traditional prescription drugs, users need to onboard digitally and often need personal technology products to do so.
"I was lucky enough to be part of some early pilot studies with digital therapeutics products and was able to sit with clinicians, sit with patients and watch them use early versions of our product," David Zuckerman, digital health partnerships lead with Takeda, said during a HealthTech Build panel moderated by MobiHealthNews.
The success metric is perhaps the peace of mind for the user or even for the end user," Donoghue said.
"If you really want to empower the patient, then it's the patient who decides most of the time when there is a need to report information or not," D'hont said.
Not all patients are going through the same journey, Donoghue said.
But they were wearing gloves, so that is an example that you need to think through that journey, and the conditions and the environment the user is in when they are using the product," Donoghue said.</p>
