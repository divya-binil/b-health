<p>During a December Becker's Hospital Review webinar sponsored by Everbridge, Roberta Schwartz, PhD, executive vice president and chief innovation officer of Houston Methodist, discussed how the organization's Center for Innovation helps select the best technologies to implement and described some recent successes.
Houston Methodist's Center for Innovation evaluates new offerings by conducting pilots and determining whether to implement these offerings.
From scheduling an appointment, orchestrating virtual care or guiding an inpatient hospital stay, Houston Methodist has implemented digital solutions that make the patient's experience seamless.
Analysis of data using technology has found, for example, that "about 50 percent of patients who have knee operations call within 48 hours to ask when they are allowed to drive again," Dr. Schwartz said.
Houston Methodist's journey evaluating, selecting and implementing innovative digital solutions has improved experiences for patients, providers, staff and the entire organization.</p>
