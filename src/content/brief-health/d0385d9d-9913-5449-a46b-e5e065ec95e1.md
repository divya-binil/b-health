<p>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. – Velatura Services (Velatura) today announced that it has been selected as part of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Health Equity Initiative, a $40 million, three-year commitment supporting organizations that are developing solutions to advance health equity. With this additional support from AWS, Velatura will work with community partners in a large county in the southeast United States to enhance its existing technology platform capabilities beyond traditional healthcare purposes to facilitate the exchange of meaningful data with social service organizations, with the goal of enabling whole-person care and reducing barriers to accessing services for vulnerable populations. The AWS Health Equity Initiative will allow Velatura to bolster the work we do to break down data silos and provide essential data management infrastructure to advance data exchange that is a vital to reduce disparities and improve the well-being of our communities.</p>
