<p>Decision-makers must do more with less and make smart software investments to save costs and boost efficiencies in both the short and long term as hospitals and health systems continue to be overstretched by negative operating margins, competitive challenges, and manpower shortages. According to research from Bain &amp; Company, 45% of providers have raised their software investments over the previous year, and 95% anticipate making new software purchases in the upcoming year, thus decision-makers concur that now is not the time to reduce software investment. The difference between surviving difficult times and prospering in them can be made by making the correct investment in healthcare software. Software investments can help with healthcare operations, or the nonclinical procedures that keep hospitals and health systems running.</p>
