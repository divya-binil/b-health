<p>Ransomware and other cyberattacks on healthcare organizations are growing rapidly in numbers and scope. To better protect their high-value data, organizations need to look at the vulnerability of their medical devices which are increasingly becoming a path of attack. An important step in securing those devices is having an accurate risk profile for each of them.</p><p><strong>More Connected Devices</strong></p><p>The number of connected devices has exploded in recent years and is expected to continue to grow at an accelerated rate. What we are seeing is the rise of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) where devices are connected to each other and to clinical applications including EMRs.</p><p><a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/internet-of-things-iot-in-healthcare-market-102188">Fortune Business Insights</a> forecasts the market will grow to $446.52 billion USD by 2028, a 5-fold increase over the market size in 2021 ($89.07 billion). There are several factors driving this growth and none of them show any signs of abating:</p><ul><li>The need for real-time data by clinicians</li><li>Increased adoption of Remote Patient Monitoring</li><li>Integration of devices with AI</li><li>Continued investment in Telehealth and Care-at-Home</li></ul>
