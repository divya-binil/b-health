<p>Part of that strategic direction was working with technology companies to ensure that City of Hope leveraged telehealth in a high-quality, patient-centric way, while easing the burden of travel times for patients undergoing treatment.
Suddenly, City of Hope needed to rapidly scale its telehealth infrastructure to meet the needs of patients.
"At a time when the American Cancer Society estimates 87% of cancer patients and survivors had their care disrupted due to the coronavirus, City of Hope offered uninterrupted cancer care and used telehealth when appropriate to evaluate patients, manage side effects of treatment, review labs and scans, answer questions, and offer reassurance to patients and their families."
Even when patients came in person, City of Hope used telehealth to include family members and other members of a patient's care team seamlessly in the visits.
Prior to working with Amwell, City of Hope delivered telehealth services, but the technology it used was not integrated with other systems, leaving room for an improved care journey for patients and providers.</p>
