<p>Telemedicine saw a tremendous uptick in usage in 2020; these services had been widely accessible for some time but had been underutilised, with many doctors not even offering them before the pandemic. 85% of them were using telehealth as of the beginning of this year, which was a significant shift quickly. According to a study by research firm Sage Growth Partners, patients aren't the only ones who care about improving their telehealth programmes; doctors who work in practises and hospital C-suite executives also do. Only 11% of hospitals and 8% of practises reported wanting to increase their telehealth offerings, but 45% of hospitals and 35% of practises reported wanting to improve their current programme.</p>
