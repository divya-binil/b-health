<p>The rewards program will pay eligible members up to $1,000 per year to complete select tasks tracked via a wearable. UnitedHealthcare is introducing a rewards programme that will make use of wearables to give qualifying members who achieve their health objectives up to $1,000 annually. Members who participate in UnitedHealthcare Rewards and are active for at least 15 minutes each day, track their sleep for at least 14 nights, and walk at least 5,000 steps each day are rewarded with a prepaid debit card or money put into a health savings account. Additionally, beneficiaries can employ paperless billing, a biometric test, and a health survey to obtain funding. At the beginning of their plan year, certain employers with fully insured plans are eligible for the rewards programme. By 2024, the company hopes that self-funded clients will be able to purchase the rewards programme. A more contemporary method of rewards is UnitedHealthcare Rewards.</p>
