<p>In order to provide the greatest care, patient data and information are now crucial components. The demand for data-driven, analytics-enabled, context-rich decision-making is only increasing as healthcare increasingly moves out of physical clinical settings and into digital channels. As a result, healthcare professionals work with a growing volume of data. In fact, the amount of health data doubles every 73 days due to its rapid proliferation. Electronic health records (EHRs) and other care technologies are examples of information systems that are designed to manage and enable care teams find and use a variety of data. However, a convoluted user interface and a dearth of compassionate cross-platform information transmission might occasionally make them less useful. &nbsp;As a result, healthcare professionals struggle to use more sophisticated technologies and have less time to devote to their work.</p>
