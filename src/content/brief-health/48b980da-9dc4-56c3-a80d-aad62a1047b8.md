<p>Data-driven healthcare startup Innovaccer has landed $150 million in a series E round, adding nearly $2 billion to its valuation.
"Hundreds of tech companies have tried to create a common data framework to connect the healthcare industry, but they all fell short due to extreme industry complexities or technology challenges," said Alaa Halawa, partner and head of U.S. ventures at Mubadala Capital, in a statement.
"But in just a few short years, Innovaccer has built the most successful data activation platform in the healthcare industry as proven by record rates of industry adoption.
So Innovaccer restructured its entire company around healthcare, Shashank said, and has been picking up speed ever since.
The startup also anticipates adding more solutions to its Innovation Accelerators next year, which bundle health cloud assets to help healthcare organizations more quickly solve common and high-impact use cases.</p>
