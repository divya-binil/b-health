<p>Physicians are under a lot of pressure to conduct treatments. When they move from one patient to another, informed consent frequently turns into necessary paperwork rather than a genuine conversation that involves patients and gives them agency over their own decisions. Here is an all-too-common occurrence as an illustration: When a patient signs an informed consent form, the nurse advises them to ask their doctor any questions they may have. The doctor then inquires with the patient, "Any questions?" shortly prior to the surgery. An informed consent lawsuit can result from this scenario if the patient encounters complications. Why? Considering that there is no proof that the patient was aware of any hazards or possible substitutes.</p>
