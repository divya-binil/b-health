<p>The global pandemic has revealed a strong need to equip Indonesia’s health workers with more data-related skillsets. Setiaji said there were currently more non-electronic medical records than digitised ones stored in Indonesian hospitals and community health centres – the latter locally known as puskesmas making it challenging to prepare the country's digital medical records.
Setiaji said the health ministry has been preparing nine references for data integration, which would need a certain degree of standardisation.
He also said they were testing the Indonesia Health Services (IHS) digital platform connected to the country's puskesmas, pharmacies and laboratories – to integrate around 60,000 such facilities.</p>
