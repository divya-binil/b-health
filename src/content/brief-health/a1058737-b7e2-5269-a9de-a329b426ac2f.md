    Telemedicine is a technological tool that enhances well-being all around the
    globe. Practicing medicine or performing a clinical examination from a
    distance was a mere thought until this decade's pandemic hit the world.
    Telemedicine is practicing medicine sitting on one side of a globe and
    diagnosing and treating a different individual from the opposite part of the
    world. There is a long way to go for medical practitioners to execute an
    entire clinical examination analogous to an accurate clinical examination.
    Telemedicine is a supplement to a patient's total care, not a replacement
    for in-person doctor visits. Family doctors can easily access specialists
    using telemedicine, which enables them to monitor their patients closely.
    Numerous telemedicine systems, including store and forward, real-time and
    remote, or self-monitoring, are used worldwide for education, healthcare
    delivery and control, sickness screening, and disaster management. Even if
    telemedicine cannot solve every issue, it can significantly lessen the
    strain on the healthcare system. Nevertheless, investigations performed via
    telemedicine have started incorporating various medical instruments called
    telemedicine peripherals, including electronic stethoscopes,
    teleophthalmoscopes, and video-otoscopes. The prevailing disease around the
    globe of coronavirus has remarkably debilitated the medical infrastructure
    in providing diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and follow-ups. As a result,
    there is a significant change in the way of practicing medicine and managing
    patients. Telemedicine provides timely patient care and reduces the risk of
    exposure to various communicable diseases offered to medical practitioners.
    The development of imaging technologies has significantly impacted
    dermatology, a specialty that relies on visual signals. Reviewing
    dermatology's existing situation and potential digital future, in brief, is
    the goal of this study. This study provides brief information on
    telemedicine, its application and scope in dermatology, and how it can alter
    the healthcare system.

<p>Telemedicine is a supplement to a patient's total care, not a replacement for in-person doctor visits. Family doctors can easily access specialists using telemedicine, which enables them to monitor their patients closely. Numerous telemedicine systems, including store and forward, real-time and remote, or self-monitoring, are used worldwide for education, healthcare delivery and control, sickness screening, and disaster management. Telemedicine provides timely patient care and reduces the risk of exposure to various communicable diseases offered to medical practitioners. This study provides brief information on telemedicine, its application and scope in dermatology, and how it can alter the healthcare system. In scientific words, telemedicine is "the usage of medicinal knowledge borrowed from one place to another via computerized transmission for improving the clinical health status of a patient." Telemedicine and telepath, as generally utilized today, can be considered interchangeable. In such cases, telemedicine substantially contributes to providing quality and affordable healthcare to India's poorest citizens and is anticipated to close the health disparity between rural and urban areas. Most doctors believe enhancing the quality of care is their foremost reason for enforcing telemedicine, as it helps them deliver timely patient care.</p><p>Benefits seen in case of patients are frequent communications with their physician, open access to specialists, saved time and expenditure on travel (especially for rural patients), contact with the medical practitioners at their convenience, reduced wait hours, convenient, on-demand care, motivate them to be actively engaged with treatment decisions. Statistics involving patients' perspectives toward telemedicine prove that 76% prioritize gaining access to healthcare over their need for face-to-face interaction with physicians. More than two-thirds of patients say telemedicine gave them a sense of fulfillment with medical care. Dermatology residents and fellows Despite their general preference for the latter, residents were equally adept at accurately diagnosing dermatopathology patients when assessed using virtual and glass slide microscopy. Residents and medical students can learn about dermatology using teledermatology as a teaching method. Survey Assessment of teledermatology's effectiveness in teaching the six essential clinical competencies and how dermatology residents and medical students perceive it.</p><p>In patient care, medical knowledge, practice-based learning, improvement, and systems-based practice, teledermatology is appreciated as a teaching tool for dermatology.Prospective study Analyze the diagnostic and treatment agreement between the resident and attending dermatologists responding to primary care providers' stored and forwarded teledermatology consults. Dermatology residency programs Out of the 72 respondents, 34 (47%) programs used telemedicine as a component of their residency training, with store and forward technology being the most popular (85%) and live interactive (35%) or a combination of the two techniques being used. The survey results reveal a training gap for dermatology residents in telemedicine. Store and forward teledermatology and real-time interactive teledermatology result in average reductions of 45.5 percent to 61.5 percent in in-person dermatological consultations. Clinical outcomes for patients who receive teledermatology care or are managed by it are on par with traditional medicine. In practically every area of dermatology, including research, clinical practice, dermatology education and training, and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases as well as patient follow-up, digital dermatology has found application. Teledermatology provides specialized medical care with reduced diagnostic precision and a more significant proportion of incorrect diagnoses.</p><p>The doctor must have direct knowledge of the patient's clinical history or have access to it during medical care to safeguard the patient's privacy and intimacy and the doctor-patient relationship. Additionally, concerning teledermatology, medical practitioners must take extra care to ensure that the images are encrypted or coded when they are updated or added to the clinical history to avoid access by unauthorized individuals. To promote the use of telemedicine, "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) comprises four divisions, including the establishment of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services." Focusing on these aspects will ultimately facilitate the usage and elaboration of telemedicine. The ACA includes several services to support telemedicine and gives the new CMMI the ability to research and develop innovative care models that adopt technology, such as electronic monitoring, in various care settings. The project looks at the provision of telemedicine services in managing behavioral health disorders and stroke, in addition to initiatives to increase the ability of doctors and other non-medical individuals to deliver health care for people with long-term and complex medical diseases.</p><p>Additionally, the law needs accountable care organizations (ACOs) to develop strategies to advocate evidence-based medicine, patient involvement, records standards, and cost estimates and coordinate care using telemedicine, distant patient monitoring, and other supporting technologies. For the sake of increase in the availability of telemedicine services in India, "ISRO collaborated with the Department of Information Technology (DIT), the Ministry of External Affairs, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and the state governments." "The Ministry of Health under the Government of India has included initiatives like the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP), National Cancer Network (ONET), National Rural Telemedicine Network, National Medical College Network, and the Digital Medical Library Network" to consolidate the public health data that is currently available and provide easy entry. Two other praiseworthy initiatives included the organization of a "National Telemedicine Task Force by the Health Ministry in 2005 and the creation of standardized telemedicine practice guidelines by the Department of Information Technology in the Government of India". Some effectively appointed telehealth services in India include mammography services at "Sri Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi; oncology at the Regional Cancer Center, Trivandrum; surgical services at Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, School of Telemedicine and Biomedical Informatics".</p><p>The "National Rural Telemedicine Network for e-Healthcare delivery and the National Medical College Network (NMCN)" for interconnecting medical colleges across the nation have been established by the telemedicine division of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India. The aim and vision of incorporating telemedicine and virtual care in the healthcare system were to deliver optimum healthcare, which facilitated addressing long waiting hours and the threat of disease progression in social distancing, aid hospitals, and clinics. Reduction in real-time visits to the medical centers and minimizing one-on-one interchange between physicians and their patients, virtual treatment, and monitoring solutions decrease the transmission of potent microbiological agents and shield medical practitioners from diseases. Telemedicine and online applications or websites empower the medical fraternity by providing aid in managing extensive outbreaks and emergencies in highly unpredictable times. Telehealth is extensively available, affordable, and accepted by medical practitioners; with COVID-19 spreading and various cities undergoing lockdown due to the high infectivity of the coronavirus, the use of telemedicine by medical practitioners as a tool of diagnosis and treatment was considered an obligation.</p>
