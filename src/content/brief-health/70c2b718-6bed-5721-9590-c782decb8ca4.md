<p>The LG Electronics North American Innovation Center, LG NOVA, has selected the Finalist companies for its Mission for the Future global challenge program.
Representing multiple potential business paths in three industries, the companies will be working with the LG NOVA team to collaborate on new business ventures, alongside continuing to grow and scale their companies, qualifying for potential investment from LG and other investors within LG NOVA ecosystem to develop impactful solutions for people, communities and the planet.
"This inaugural year of our challenge demonstrated how effective and powerful collaboration between technology startups and established corporations can help accelerate the innovation process," said LG Electronics Senior Vice President of Innovation Dr. Sokwoo Rhee and head of LG NOVA.
</p><p>With this selection of companies, LG NOVA will build new businesses in Digital Health, Electric Mobility and the Metaverse and pursue multiple paths to deliver new services and solutions that will help us move forward faster into the future.
Digital Health – With digital health capabilities key to enabling the delivery of healthcare to diverse and disparate communities, LG NOVA is working to expand and scale greater access to healthcare and personal health services.
Expanding upon new services available to doctors and providers, LG's work with Mindset Medical is expected to make it easier for medical providers to understand patient health over time or during live virtual doctor visits.
Electric Mobility – With LG's commitment to sustainability as an organization, LG NOVA is working to pursue new opportunities to expand access to electric vehicle (EV) and electric mobility solutions by enabling more businesses to leverage their infrastructure to provide EV services.
By working with I-EMS, LG will help modernize the electricity grid and optimize energy management to deliver better power management solutions for the market.
LG NOVA, the North American Innovation Center for global innovation leader LG Electronics, is a team focused on bringing innovation from the outside to LG.</p>
