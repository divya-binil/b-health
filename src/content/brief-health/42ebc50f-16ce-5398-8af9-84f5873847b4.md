<p>As the workforce changes and systems adopt digital technology to increase access to care, healthcare will appear substantially different in 2033. In order to get their opinions on what the hospital of the future will look like, Becker's contacted hospital executives. All of the leaders discussed in this article will be presenting at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago's April 3-6, 2023, Becker's Healthcare 13th Annual Meeting. Contact Mariah Muhammad at mmuhammad@beckershealthcare.com if you're interested in speaking. jcole@beckershealthcare.com is the email address to reach Jessica Cole for more information about sponsorship options. Becker's is interviewing healthcare executives who will present at our conference as part of a continuing series. These are the responses from our speakers at the occasion.</p>
