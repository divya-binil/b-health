<p>Improved data accessibility will lead to insights, innovation and the creation of custom applications.
Data availability is blocked by nonparticipating incumbents and a lack of API development.
Healthcare data standards and tools have yet to be developed.
The utilization of healthcare data will expand medical knowledge and fortify new research.
Implementation of data-driven medicine requires advancements in healthcare technology and research.
Data-driven medicine is not being adopted evenly across the industry. &nbsp;Improved data standards are needed throughout the digital health ecosystem.
With a restructured healthcare IT infrastructure and improved data utility, novel healthcare applications will be developed.
Through marketplace channels, novel digital health applications will package and deliver technical capabilities to providers and consumers alike.
Accelerate application adoption across an organization or the entire industry.
More development will address gaps in current digital health capabilities.
These applications are an umbrella over digital health, enabling a secure online access point for patients and providers. Increases stakeholder engagement and technology adoption through seamless access to the digital health ecosystem.
Access to core EHR data and additional health and wellness tools and services. Improves stakeholder loyalty to a specific health network.
Lagging technological adoption among user groups means that patients prefer in-person communication and providers are more comfortable with existing EHR technologies.
Health network administrators need to justify the cost of transitioning to a new patient engagement ecosystem.
Adoption and utility of technology are dependent on underlying IT infrastructure.</p>
