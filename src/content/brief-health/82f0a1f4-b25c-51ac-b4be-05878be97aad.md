<p>From the approval of a new prescription VR treatment to renewed privacy concerns, 2021 has been full of digital health developments. Indeed, some news might have gone under the radar or might require a quick refresher; so we’re wrapping up 2021 with a round-up of 10 of the most important digital health news of this year.</p><h2>1. FDA-approved prescription VR treatment for chronic back pain</h2><p>In mid-November, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785609/vr-chronic-pain-fda">FDA authorised a virtual reality (VR) system as a prescription treatment</a> for chronic back pain. Called EaseVRx, it combines cognitive behaviour therapy techniques and breathing exercises to help relax, distract and improve awareness of internal signals. The system was used in <a href="https://www.jmir.org/2021/2/e26292/">an 8-week study</a>, where those who used EaseVRx were found to have significant pain reduction.</p><p>It’s a clear trend that the FDA has been taking lately regarding <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/what-are-digital-therapeutics">digital therapeutics</a> (DTx). In 2020, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292267/fda-adhd-video-game-prescription-endeavor-rx-akl-t01-project-evo">approved EndeavorRx</a>, a prescription video game for the treatment of children with ADHD. In October 2021, the regulatory body <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736894/fda-vr-tv-movies-treatment-lazy-eye-amblyopia">cleared a VR treatment for lazy eye</a> in children. It could be issuing approvals of more research-backed DTx in the near future.</p>
