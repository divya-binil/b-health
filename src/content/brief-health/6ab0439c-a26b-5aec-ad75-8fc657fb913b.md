Investment in healthcare artificial intelligence startups and companies focused on mental health and wellness soared in the second quarter as both sectors hit funding highs, according to a new report.

Healthcare AI companies raised $864 million in the second quarter, compared to the $764 million AI startups raised in the second quarter of 2018, according to technology market intelligence company CB Insights' global healthcare report released on Tuesday morning.

The $864 million in AI healthcare investment was led by a $200 million round to Tempus in May. Tempus develops an AI-enabled precision medicine software based on its collection and analysis of clinical and molecular data.
