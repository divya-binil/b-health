<p>The United States spends about <a href="https://www.wfae.org/health/2021-09-14/u-s-health-care-administration-costs-are-responsible-for-at-least-25-of-medical-bills">$1 trillion</a> per year on healthcare administration. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/policy-ten-administrators-for-every-one-us-doctor-092813">95%</a> of healthcare workforce growth since 1990 has been administrative. But adding administrative staff hasn’t helped health systems stay on top of the increase in manual work queues, and it certainly hasn’t been improving outcomes for patients. So when asked if automation can drive better health system outcomes, through my work in healthcare technology, I know for a fact that it already is.&nbsp;</p><p>Research has shown automation’s power to eliminate inefficiencies and reduce waste. The <a href="https://www.caqh.org/sites/default/files/explorations/index/2021-caqh-index.pdf">2021 CAQH Index</a> estimated that the medical industry has already saved $166 billion through automation, and further automation could save an additional 48% of the total money spent on administrative transactions. Greater efficiency yields better financial outcomes as well as a better patient experience.&nbsp;</p>
