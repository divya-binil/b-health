<p>According to Taoiseach Micheál Martin, a new project to fund and create female-centric, tech-based healthcare products "has the potential to enable a more equal healthcare system." Half of the world's population is made up of women, but less than 2% of global investment has gone toward women's health research, creating a sizable untapped market for business owners and opportunities to advance women's healthcare, according to speakers at an Irish femtech event at University College Cork. According to Dr. Tanya Mulcahy, director of the Health Innovation Hub Ireland, Ireland can develop a thriving ecosystem for femtech, or technology geared toward the health and welfare of women. According to conference participants, women control 70% to 80% of all consumer spending and make the majority of decisions regarding their own and their families' healthcare.</p>
