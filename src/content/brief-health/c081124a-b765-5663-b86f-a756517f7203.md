<p>The Global Mercy joins Africa Mercy with donation of three clinical decisions support tools to aid clinicians onboard ships in providing the best care anywhere around the world.
Wolters Kluwer, Health announced today that it has donated three market-leading clinical decision support (CDS) tools including UpToDate®, Lexicomp®, and Lippincott Procedures® to Mercy Ships, a global humanitarian organization that operates two floating hospitals serving underprivileged populations.
The two-part goal of the new Global Mercy is not only to treat patients as a state-of-the-art hospital, but also to help train clinicians in a part of the world where the latest clinical training and evidence can be hard to find.</p>
