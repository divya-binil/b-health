<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare workplace demands and the constant pursuit of success often lead to one detrimental phenomenon: </span><b>Workforce Burnout</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As many people work from home thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the lines between work and home life are blurring. And it has rather become easy to be overwhelmed and exhausted. But there&#8217;s hope: digital health.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether through mindfulness exercises, virtual therapy sessions, or even just taking a break to move and stretch, digital health tools provide a convenient and accessible way to prioritize our mental health and combat burnout. This blog will explore 4 ways to use digital health solutions to tackle healthcare workforce burnout.</span></p>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63425" src="https://www.healthcareguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/burnout-2161445_1280.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workforce burnout is a condition of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by extreme and prolonged stress at work. It is a feeling of chronic fatigue and a loss of motivation and enthusiasm for one&#8217;s career. It occurs when employees feel berated, emotionally depleted, and unable to match the constant demands of their job. Such a state can negatively impact a worker&#8217;s productivity, health, and overall quality of life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UN&#8217;s specialized agency, the World Health Organization (WHO), recognizes burnout as an occupational phenomenon. According to a Gallup survey, full-time workers experience burnout at a rate of two-thirds. Additionally, the American Psychological Association reports that burnout increases healthcare costs and decreases job satisfaction.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Has a lot of disagreements with coworkers or supervisors.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shows physical symptoms of anxiety, headaches, insomnia, and stomach problems.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demotivated, disinterested, and unproductive.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decreased ability to perform tasks that previously were manageable.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>What Contributes To a Burnout?</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pushing Physical &amp; Mental Limits</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cognitive Loads</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inadequate Emotional &amp; Pain Management Support</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Digital Health and its Potential Role in Addressing Workforce Burnout Issues</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world has gotten remote. Employees working on laptops and in comfort face more burnout than regular office-based employees. Having said so, whether we&#8217;re talking about a remote or office-based employee, burnout is burnout. The effects of it won&#8217;t be any different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Burnout issues are a significant organizational problem that leads to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced employee engagement,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High turnover rates, and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decreased profits.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although employees turn to </span><a href="https://oklahomapaindoc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pain management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and supplements centers for relief or even consider vitamin supplements to improve their physical health, the issue goes far beyond physical well-being.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><b>So are digital health solutions an answer to all of this?â€”Question we must all ask!</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The journal published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research supports using digital interventions to alleviate stress and pain, thereby mitigating workforce burnout. A systematic review of 69 studies found that digital health solutions can reduce burnout by up to 27%.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If &#8220;digital health&#8221; is a new concept, digital health is the technology that helps manage and improve health and healthcare-related activities. Some of its examples are wearable devices, telemedicine, mobile health apps, electronic health records, and more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital health addresses workforce burnout by providing remote and telemedicine services. One example of a digital health solution is mindfulness-based training, effectively reducing burnout among healthcare providers. An analysis in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that mindfulness-based stress reduction reduced burnout among healthcare workers by 10%.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growing body of research suggests that digital health has great potential to mitigate the negative effects of burnout among employees everywhere. And we will likely see a significant reduction in workforce burnout due to digital health.</span></p>
