<p>Laura Cooley, senior director of education and outreach at the Academy of Communication in Healthcare, dishes out tips to improve the telehealth experience at the Patient Experience Summit this morning.<br><br>Laura Cooley, senior director of education and outreach at the Academy of Communication in Healthcare, has seen how the patient experience is being transformed by technology firsthand.&nbsp;</p><p>When she went to schedule her annual women’s health exam, she found a digital platform that could help her find a clinician that fit her needs, took her insurance, and had the calendar dates she wanted. It also let her see reports of other patients’ experiences and book online.&nbsp;</p><p>“So, I was very happy to quickly and easily find someone, find a calendar appointment, schedule that and enter all my information. It was an excellent patient experience from a technology perspective,” Cooley said during the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.empathyandinnovation.com/cleveland/2020/schedule">Patient Experience Summit</a>, put on by the Cleveland Clinic and HIMSS.&nbsp;</p>
