<p>We are surrounded with bits of knowledge, proof, and data everywhere we go. We now recognise that reaping the benefits of these knowledge seeds can result in profound revelations that alter practically every aspect of our lives, including the way we finance, shop, and take care of ourselves. All agree that data has great potential. How we securely and methodically use data to create worthwhile and appreciated outcomes in healthcare is still a mystery. Efforts to effectively exploit data insights inside the healthcare system have been impeded by worries about data privacy and ownership, disjointed gathering systems, and a lack of standardisation. However, one European nation may have discovered a solution to many of these problems by reevaluating data-enabled healthcare.</p>
