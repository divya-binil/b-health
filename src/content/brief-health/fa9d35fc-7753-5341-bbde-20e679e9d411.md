<p>Withings has acquired health and fitness app 8fit to expand the company’s portfolio of tech-enabled consumer health offerings, the device maker announced Wednesday.
8fit’s data-driven platform, launched in 2014, provides personalized meal and workout plans as well as self-care recommendations to its users, building on Withings’ strategy of delivering more health tech tailored to the individual.
But while these tools can help consumers feel more in control of their health, the technologies must prioritize finding ways to support each user to keep them engaged over the long term, Withings CEO Mathieu Letombe said.
“From the services we offer, it’s clear that Withings and 8fit are aligned to help users achieve their health goals,” said Lisette Fabian, CEO of 8fit.</p>
