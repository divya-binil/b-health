<p style="text-align: justify;">In the wake of the pandemic and growing concern over global health issues associated with aging, mortality, child illness, epidemics, and more, digital healthcare has evolved to take center stage. Information technology was always a vital part of the healthcare industry. However, with the advancement in the field, the digital healthcare industry is witnessing endless possibilities for transforming healthcare services. The COVID-19 pandemic has fueled this transformation, with increased demand for contactless symptom checks, remote consultation, remote patient monitoring, and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In recent times, digital health has utilized AI and data obtained from secure sources to provide patient-focused care and assist with prevention strategies. AI and Machine Learning led to the unforeseen growth of the digital health sector with innovations like ingestible sensors, robotic caretakers, apps to monitor patients remotely, and more. As per <a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/digital-health-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Precedence Research,</a> with more upcoming innovations, the digital health market will witness a CAGR of 19.4% from 2023-2032 and is expected to reach $1,694.21 billion in 2032.</p>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73618" src="https://www.healthcareguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Patient-Safety_01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="592" srcset="https://www.healthcareguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Patient-Safety_01.jpg 1000w, https://www.healthcareguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Patient-Safety_01-768x455.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/insightimg/Digital-Health-Market-Size.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, digitization of healthcare also demands enhancing patient security while providing convenient healthcare services. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4859641/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data security and privacy</a> of patient information is becoming more and more vulnerable due to data breaches and cyberattacks. Hence, while addressing patient concerns, robust cybersecurity measures need to be in place to balance convenience and security in the digital health sector.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Convenience vs. Patient Safety: Ethical Considerations</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we explore the vulnerability of the digital health sector to data theft and system breaches, one question arises. Although technological evolution has transformed the healthcare industry and improved patient convenience with services like mobile health applications, cloud-based management, and more, how is this happening without undermining the security of healthcare data? With the increased use of digital space to provide convenient healthcare, patient data privacy remains at stake.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While patients desire convenient methods to access healthcare benefits, they still are skeptical about how their data might be used, how it can negatively impact their insurance and credit card access, and more. The mounting competition between convenience and privacy is currently a top priority for healthcare organizations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As such, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8521799/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethical considerations</a> in providing digital healthcare, namely autonomy, justice, beneficence, and non-maleficence, have taken predominance to balance these values.</p>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73619" src="https://www.healthcareguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Patient-Safety_02.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://www.healthcareguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Patient-Safety_02.jpg 1080w, https://www.healthcareguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Patient-Safety_02-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.healthcareguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Patient-Safety_02-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.healthcareguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Patient-Safety_02-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.healthcareguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Patient-Safety_02-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.healthcareguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Patient-Safety_02-125x125.jpg 125w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://cdn-hobgh.nitrocdn.com/pFjUWzeXAHMPpHipSeyFRMVQGbXHdfGD/assets/images/optimized/rev-42ef90a/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-pillars-image.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>
<h3>Autonomy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Autonomy in digital health refers to a person’s own will and right to make choices about their healthcare. Obliging to the principle of autonomy, the physician discloses crucial information about the benefits and risks of engaging in digital health methods, which are essential for the patient to understand and willfully consent to the treatment procedures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Digitization in healthcare has encouraged the free flow of communication between patients and doctors, enabling patients to be more active regarding diagnosis and treatment plans. Unlike the existing process, patients are more engaged in discussions with their caregivers, facilitating a more collaborative approach toward health management. Their self-efficacy and autonomy over their choices are visible through the increased use of wearable fitness technology like smartwatches which help them monitor their sleep cycles, heart rate, and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, patients are provided adequate information about the collection of their data and how organizations will preserve and utilize this data, giving due regard to their privacy and security.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Justice</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another pillar of medical ethics is justice, which refers to fair and equitable healthcare resources for all. Ethical considerations in digital health arise when there is a question of accessibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Availing of digital health resources depends on certain factors like affordability and availability of technological equipment or the needs of a certain section of people. For instance, people dealing with rare disorders, aging citizens, or homeless people can have little to no benefits from digital health services. Hence it is crucial to incorporate fair access while planning and implementing digital tools in the healthcare sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it can sometimes go beyond affordability and get impacted by an individual’s ability to deal with digital healthcare tools. If a section of the population is unable to use healthcare technologies resulting from digital illiteracy, it can trigger an unjust healthcare design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But digital health facilities have also empowered some people who otherwise cannot benefit from conventional healthcare due to geographical or physical constraints. In this regard, digitization in healthcare facilitates fair access to health resources and improves the efficiency of medical services with due consideration of patient privacy.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Beneficence</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another core ethic of medical practice is beneficence which drives healthcare workers to act in the best interest of the patients. Like conventional healthcare practice, it is a crucial part of decision-making in digital healthcare, which requires physicians to consider all the risks and benefits of a treatment plan before proceeding with it through digital mediums.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the healthcare sector seeing dramatic transformation with the increased usage of healthcare information technology (HIT) and consumer health informatics technology (CHIT), and more, it is playing a crucial role in empowering patients to manage their health. Moreover, it is also decreasing the patient&#8217;s dependency on professional caregivers, improving access to medical resources, and enabling the patients to remain and heal in their homes rather than staying in an institution. All of these are beneficent outcomes of digitization in healthcare which also involves caution and careful consideration of patient information.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Non-Maleficence</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Physicians are bound by the principle of non-maleficence, which requires them to avoid causing harm to their patients, both physically and emotionally. They must take great care to weigh the benefits and drawbacks before making any decisions. While the advancement in digital health technologies has enabled healthcare professionals to provide efficient and effective medical care, it also has the potential to adversely affect patients with the disclosure of sensitive data, incorrect computerized diagnoses, and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As such, clear communication is a priority in digital mediums to enable patients to take charge of their health and make informed decisions. Maintaining the privacy of the patients with careful handling of their health information and considering the cost-effectiveness of digital health tools also hold significance in implementing the non-maleficence principle.</p>
