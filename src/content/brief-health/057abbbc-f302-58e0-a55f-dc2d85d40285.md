<p>Aledade, which works with primary care providers to build tech-enabled accountable care organizations, raised $123 million in a Series E funding round led by OMERS Growth Equity.
Aledade said it plans to use the funding to focus on offering more value-based care arrangements for seniors covered by Medicare Advantage and to expand offerings under its new health services subsidiary Aledade Care Solutions.
Aledade is extremely well positioned in this market environment to accelerate our work to meet patients where they are, especially in Medicare Advantage, and seize new opportunities to expand wraparound patient care services. The company announced a $225 million Series C funding round in June last year.
Choix, a telemedicine clinic for reproductive care, raised $1 million in seed funding led by Elevate Capital.</p>
