<p>San Francisco-based Osmind announced today that its electronic health record system for mental health clinicians has integrated Zoom virtual visits within its technology platform as part of the company's regulatory-compliant ISV Partner Program.
The addition of Integrated Zoom virtual visits enables mental health providers to expand treatment options for vulnerable patients, including those with moderate-to-severe mental health conditions where patients may not have the ability to leave their homes, according to the company's announcement.
Clinicians create a virtual mental health appointment using Zoom's secure, HIPAA-compliant video technology, share that link with the patient and launch the online meeting directly from the Osmind patient app.</p>
