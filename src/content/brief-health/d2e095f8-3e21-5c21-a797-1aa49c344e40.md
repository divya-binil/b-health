<p>Right before her afternoon run, Rita pairs her smart preventer inhaler with her smartphone and takes two puffs. Checking the companion app, she finds that she took the right dose and waited for <a href="https://www.capecodhealth.org/medical-services/lung-care/using-an-inhaler-youre-probably-doing-it-wrong-/">the recommended 30 seconds</a> between inhalations. Relieved that her workout will not trigger her asthma symptoms, she begins tracking it on her smartwatch.</p><p>Following the 40 minute run, Rita checks her <a href="https://www.aafa.org/asthma/asthma-diagnosis/lung-function-tests/peak-flow-meters.aspx">peak flow reading</a> – or how well she exhales – with her smart, handheld peak flow monitor. This enables her to determine whether her workout caused any narrowing of her airways, which could lead to an asthma flare-up well before symptoms show. The reading she gets is within the normal range, indicating that her preventive corticosteroid puffs helped her stay on track with her fitness goals.</p>
