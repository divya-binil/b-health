<p>Goal is to offer college students access to medical, behavioral health and musculoskeletal services through their phone or laptop.
Delaware-based health system ChristianaCare is partnering with medical and therapy service providers to offer integrated virtual health services 24/7 to colleges, universities and other institutions of higher education.
“For college and university student health services and administrators, this partnership offers a powerful new way to provide comprehensive, affordable health solutions that benefit students,” Anderson said.
We are excited to partner with colleges and universities to strengthen their student health programs by creating a comprehensive virtual care solution to meet their student’s health care needs.”</p>
