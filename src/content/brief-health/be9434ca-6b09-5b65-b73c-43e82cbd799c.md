<p>With soaring demand for medical professionals to address the pandemic and students without access to hands-on training in hospitals, a new technique rose to prominence: remote learning with patient simulators.
For many years, patient simulators have provided incredible value in medical education.
Much like airplane pilots who train in flight simulators before ever getting into an aircraft’s cockpit, medical simulation allows learners to experience realistic training scenarios first-hand prior to treating live patients.
The National Nursing Board has recognized the value of simulation by allowing nursing students to earn up to 50% of their clinical time on simulation.1 Simulation allows nursing students to review and repeat low-frequency, high-risk scenarios until they develop the muscle memory and technique that is required to handle critical situations.
They range from basic types of skills trainers to more sophisticated high-fidelity simulators that mimic a real patient’s response to treatment.
Conversely, more sophisticated patient simulators offer hyper-realistic training that allows learners to fully experience critical procedures before ever performing them on a patient.
Technologically, these simulators are highly equipped with circuits, pumps, and motors that not only allow her to mimic the physicality of a real patient but to interact with real clinical equipment.
Simulators also played a significant role in preparing medical professionals to treat COVID-19 patients.
At Gaumard, our most advanced product combines mixed reality technology with a high-fidelity birthing simulator.
With patient simulators, learners can practice these skills repeatedly to gain the muscle memory and critical thinking skills needed to react quickly during complicated procedures.</p>
