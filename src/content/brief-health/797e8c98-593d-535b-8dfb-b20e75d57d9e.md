      Healthcare labor management is not easy. Healthcare is not an assembly
      line, and one solution does not fit all. Getting the right person to the
      right place at the right time to care for patients is a huge
      responsibility, and doing it correctly, at the right cost, is a science.


      We've been helping provider organizations do this – and only this for more
      than 20 years.

      We get it. And, we’ve been successful in applying what we’ve learned along
      the way to help others solve the same challenges. We’d like to share this
      with you.


      We will help you reduce the chaos, unnecessary expense, and stress
      typically associated with staffing and scheduling in healthcare. We will
      partner to help you solve immediate challenges, like excessive overtime,
      then grow with you, when you are ready, to deploy more advanced strategies
      and tools to better manage your staff.
