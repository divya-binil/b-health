title: Is It Time To Get Away From The Idea Of Patient Experience
---

For the last 20 years, the healthcare industry has been slowly shifting from fee-for-service to value-based care. We’ve seen the advent of the triple aim, the quadruple aim, pay-for-performance, and ACOs. All of this in an attempt to move from paying for healthcare based on quantity to paying for quality and outcomes. In the meantime, we’ve also seen a rise in consumerism and a focus on patient experience. And we tie those to the goals of value-based care. But the very word experience suggests we are still thinking about healthcare as episodic, and episodic care is susceptible to massive disruptions like those we’ve seen with COVID-19.
