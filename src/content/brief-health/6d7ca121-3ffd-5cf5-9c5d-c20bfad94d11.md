<p>The partnership allows DarioHealth to integrate data from Dexcom's continuous glucose monitors in its chronic condition management platform. In order to incorporate Dexcom's continuous glucose monitors into DarioHealth's platform for managing chronic conditions, the two companies have partnered. Through the agreement, Dexcom CGMs, wearable sensors that automatically track blood glucose levels for people with diabetes, will be able to provide data to Dario's digital health solutions for metabolic health. According to Dario, incorporating CGM data would give users more individualised support and direction. "Today, around two million individuals use a continuous glucose monitor, and the inclusion of that data in Dario's platform increases our capacity to provide more people with diabetes with a dynamic, highly relevant experience. In the long run, every Dario member will profit from this exciting development as the CGM data improves our entire data ecosystem "Dario's president, Rick Anderson, stated in a statement.</p>
