<p>These four layoffs of payers were reported by Becker's this year. 373 employees of Blue Shield of California will be let go statewide by January 25. The majority of the job cuts are taking place in the Sacramento area, but they also affect the insurer's Oakland headquarters and other areas of the state. As it gets ready to close the majority of its SeniorBridge sites countrywide, Humana plans to lay off 157 workers at its SeniorBridge facility in Jupiter, Florida. 149 caregivers, six field nurses, a sales executive, and a care supervisor are among those laid off. 150 employees, or 5% of Bright Health's total, were let go in March. The business said in November that it would let go of 99 more employees from its Minnesota headquarters in the first few weeks of 2023.&nbsp;In August, GoHealth, an online insurance marketplace, let off a large portion of its support staff and agent personnel. The Chicago Tribune stated that 800 people would be let go, although CEO Vijay Kotte would not say how many workers were involved.</p>
