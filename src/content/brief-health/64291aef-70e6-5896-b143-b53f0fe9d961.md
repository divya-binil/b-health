<p>Dave Vennergrund, GDIT vice president of artificial intelligence and data insights, discussed the software's potential to assist in screening patients for possibly harmful diseases.<br><br>After sharing GDIT’s capabilities in image analytics, the VA pivoted our team to the challenge of diagnosing skin lesions.
Tejasvi was fundamentally interested in improving the process by which skin lesion images are captured by technicians and primary care physicians and forwarded to dermatologists and oncologists for preliminary diagnosis.
Furthermore, &nbsp;Tejasvi and our research team found that image classifiers built on deep learning models can be effective in classifying skin lesions into benign or malignant disease classes.</p>
