<p>In an effort to "strategic manage" their operations in the area, Sanford Health informed its workforce on Wednesday, Oct. 19, that it will start terminating some non-clinical staff members. The firm would be changing its leadership and streamlining processes in an effort to cut costs, according to Bill Gassen, president and CEO of Sanford Health, in an email to staff members. Over the past two years, we have strived to rediscover our commitment to providing top-notch healthcare. The email from Gassen states that this entails cutting administrative costs, terminating projects that aren't directly related to our core mission, and making new investments to improve the care we offer. We made the really painful choice to streamline our leadership this week, so that process has continued.</p>
