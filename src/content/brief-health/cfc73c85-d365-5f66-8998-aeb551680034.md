<p>Venture capital investment in global healthtech companies is projected to reach $42 billion by the end of the year, according to Silicon Valley Bank's latest report, "The Future of HealthTech."<br>Improved consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth, plus regulatory changes that facilitated its widespread use, have driven record venture investment into those alternative care models, the report noted.
Norris said there is a record amount of venture capital still to be deployed (raised but not yet invested), but he would posit that investment will be down from the records seen in Q1 and Q2 2021, as investors slow their pace while turning their eyes to portfolio management and exit possibilities for their companies.</p>
