The survey (Center for Connected Medicine 2020) was supported by HIMSS Media, Nokia and UPMC. 101 top-level respondents participated representing various fields, such as IT, clinical and informatics, and dealing with genomics for care provision at U.S. healthcare institutions and systems.

 

The major findings of the survey are as follows:

 

There is increased implementation of precision medicine and genomic data management strategies.
Such strategies are being or planned to be rolled out on an enterprise level.
At the forefront of strategy setting are informatics personnel and clinicians.
When choosing an enterprise platform, the top criteria are the ability to facilitate re-interpretation of genomic data and support clinician notification.
The majority of respondents expect the number of vendors their institutions collaborate with to increase in the nearest future.
Key to genetic/genomic testing and precision medicine programmes expansion are clinical and cost effectiveness and reimbursement.
