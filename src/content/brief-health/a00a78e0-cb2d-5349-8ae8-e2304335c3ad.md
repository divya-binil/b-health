<p>Smart jumpsuits for babies and precision oncology are some of the innovative ways that AI could be used to turn data into actionable insights, which will be explored in more detail at HIMSS22 Europe in June. “MAIJU offers the first of its kind quantitative assessment of infant’s motor abilities through the age from supine lying to fluent walking,” explains Professor Sampsa Vanhatalo, project lead at the University of Helsinki. “At the same time, we need to remember that AI in medical applications can only be as intelligent as we allow it to be,” adds Vanhatalo. Professor Karol Sikora, chief medical officer (CMO) at cancer care vanguard, Rutherford House, believes that machine learning can benefit physicians by assisting in complex treatment decisions. He adds that for AI capability to be adopted successfully, organisations must introduce change at a manageable pace and work collaboratively to innovate on intelligent business processes.</p>
