<p>As the healthcare system continues to adapt to the realities of COVID-19, changes made now will have ripple effects over the next decade, according to a new report from analysts at Forrester.
To see success in this area continue, the analysts said, performance metrics should hold all stakeholders accountable, not just providers, and engage consumers more in their care.
A significant shift to home health occurred under the pandemic, and those gains will likely continue.
"As utilization of physical assets decreases, hospital closures will continue at a rapid pace, and health insurers will quickly swoop in to buy up assets to control the cost of care for their members," the researchers said.
As healthcare continues to embrace both digital health solutions and engaging with patients through digital avenues, it's key to build a foundation of trust, according to the report.</p>
