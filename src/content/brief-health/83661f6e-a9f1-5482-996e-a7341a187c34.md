<p>Intermountain has earned a Press Ganey Top Box Score of more than 80% for its scheduled video visit service, with patients requesting more digital engagement as they learn about the option.
"In 2020, we converted the internal acute care services to the Amwell Hospital platform," said Brian Wayling, telehealth services associate vice president at Intermountain Healthcare.
"Fundamentally, the wide dispersion of telehealth has helped Intermountain build upon our core tenets of care delivery - increased access, reduced costs, consistent patient care and improved caregiver engagement - regardless of patient location," Wayling stated.
"With more than 500 clinicians accessing the platform on a regular basis to provide care to almost 70 hospitals in nine states, Intermountain has helped tens of thousands of patients receive care closer to home, assisted local care teams in learning new skills while caring for higher acuity patients, and expanded care standards to ensure appropriate, cost-effective care is provided," he continued.
</p><p>In addition to these core types of services, Intermountain has enabled all clinical services with an EHR-embedded telehealth platform for outpatient care.
"Over the years, telehealth services have also worked extensively with Intermountain Technology Services - most notably with cybersecurity and networking â€“ to ensure our patient data is secure and protected.
As of the second quarter of 2022, Intermountain has earned a Press Ganey Top Box Score of more than 80% for its scheduled video visit service, with patients requesting more digital engagement as they learn about the option.
Intermountain was awarded $730,008 from the FCC telehealth grant program for smartphones, tablets, video conferencing equipment, and various monitoring and telehealth platforms and applications with which providers can remotely assess COVID-19 patients, conduct remote monitoring for high-risk patients by using specially configured technology kits, offer patients access to medical care and opinions from providers anywhere, and educate people and answer questions about COVID-19.</p>
