<p>Researchers for the Arch Collaborative report found that clinical end users who are satisfied with their organization's electronic health record are more likely to stay.<br><br>This week’s KLAS research found that, compared to other clinical settings, nurses are more likely to plan to leave their organizations in the next two years, but more satisfied workers with electronic health records are more likely to remain.
“Physician turnover is high, staff costs have risen, and even when organizations are able to hire new suppliers and staff, the need to train them can put a strain on existing employees,” the researchers said in the published report.
“Friction could also be reduced by preventing doctors from becoming severely exhausted in the first place – while doctors who are completely exhausted are more likely to leave, the likelihood of attrition grows rapidly starting with those reporting definite symptoms of burnout.
“Those who are very dissatisfied with the EHR have nearly three times the percentage of reports that are likely to go away than doctors who are very happy with the EHR,” the researchers said.
“When doctors see the EHR as a help rather than a hindrance, they are more likely to want to stay in their organization.”
