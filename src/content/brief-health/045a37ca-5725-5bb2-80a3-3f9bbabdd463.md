<p>Atrium Health this week announced the launch of an expansive telehealth platform that will give patients a wide range of virtual primary and specialty care options.</p><p>"Virtual health is no longer a nice-to-have or an augmentation of care," said Scott Rissmiller, MD, executive vice president and chief physician executive for Atrium Health. "It is an essential and necessary way of clinical care delivery and customer service for any healthcare system. It allows us to deliver affordable, accessible care for all."</p><p>During the pandemic, the Atrium Health Hospital at Home program allowed tens of thousands of COVID-19 patients to be treated virtually, freeing bedspace and conserving staff time and personal protective equipment.</p>
