<p>iPads will be provided to ambulance crews across England to ensure that patients get the right care faster, the NHS brass has announced. Ambulance crew<br><br>Ambulance crews will utilise the 30,000 iPads to send photographs from the scene of an incident, so specialists on standby at hospital can initiate treatment right away when the patient arrives in the emergency department. These iPads will also allow paramedics to access vital health records and help them better assess patients’ injuries and decide the course of action. Once the decision is made to bring the patient to the ED, information on the patient can also be sent ahead to speed up handovers and free ambulances to quickly attend their next call.</p><p><i>You might also like:&nbsp;</i>2020 proved to be the record year for digital health venture investment, but not for long.
