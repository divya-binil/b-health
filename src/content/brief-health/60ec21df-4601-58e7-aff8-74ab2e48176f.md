<p>In order to help seniors and vulnerable populations age gracefully in place, Connect America, a nationally renowned leader in connective care technology, today announced major improvements to its Connect America HomeTM platform. This cutting-edge, AI-powered digital health and safety platform offers continuous, secure monitoring that is non-intrusive, with both emergency and non-emergency support to help everyone live well at home. To fill in any gaps in a patient's care circle, Connect America has introduced the first-ever Care Alert Service, which sends hospital check-in and admission notifications to loved ones, caregivers, and healthcare professionals in a rapid and secure manner. A near real-time notification of a patient's hospital admission is given to authorised caregivers via the Medical Alert Connect app and by SMS text message.</p>
