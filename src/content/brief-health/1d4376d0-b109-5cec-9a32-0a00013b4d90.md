Here's what he's learned so far about their feelings on virtual care.<br><br>Sometime in 2019, I was multi-tasking and racing between exam rooms amid a controlled chaos that defines an average day in my busy clinic.</p><ul><li>Each result was from a unique individual.</li><li>Here are some comments from my patients: "I like the first visit to be in-person but follow up visits can be virtual."</li><li>Finally, make plans to have in-person visits intermittently for the virtual patients, and remember, follow-ups and patients with chronic conditions are the best candidates for telehealth visits.</li><li>According to one survey, nine in 10 Americans stated that they would cancel or reschedule a preventative care appointment due to workplace pressures.6 Less transit to and from the doctor's clinic reduces traffic congestion, traffic accidents and air pollution.</li><li>We must learn to adopt and use it to our advantage instead of as a perceived hindrance.</li></ul>
