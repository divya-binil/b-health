<p>As the year draws to a close, it is time for an overview of the development of digital health in 2022. It is simple to get lost in the noise; between January and the end of November 2022, I shared well over a thousand articles, research, and news pieces. So, just like in 2021, 2020 (and so on), I chose the 10 subjects I think will be most important to healthcare in the future. Contrary to a lot of unsubstantiated hypes (NFTs, Metaverse, to mention a few), we view DTx as a significant trend with the potential to significantly advance individualised healthcare in the near future. DTx provides solutions that are supported by clinical evidence and can be used to manage and/or enhance health issues.</p>
