<p>The idea that patients with "some acute diseases can be treated in the comfort of their home with the same degree of care and monitoring they would receive within the walls of our hospitals" is now being embraced by the newest health system. Orlando Health announced on Monday that it has received approval from Florida's Agency for Health Treatment Administration to begin providing acute hospital care to adult patients in their homes. The health system intends to begin offering Hospital Care at Home in February to a select group of patients who satisfy certain clinical requirements established by emergency department and hospital professionals. Safe treatments are available for illnesses like cellulitis, COPD, asthma, UTI, heart failure, COVID-19, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis.</p>
