<p>Conversational AI in healthcare has the potential to improve care access while empowering patients to engage in their own healthcare.<br><br>Dr. Jason Paruthi: With 60% of American adults having a chronic condition, and 90% of the USâ€™s annual healthcare expenditures ($3.5 trillion annually) allocated to people with chronic and mental conditions,1,2 we see a need for innovative, evidence-based digital health solutions to engage patients, improve their care, and drive down costs.
AI solutions can give people personalized attention and work in concert with providers by giving doctors and nurses tools that connect digital health solutions with providers and that provide more comprehensive care to patients.
Another powerful feature of conversational AI is the possibility to use it in unison with traditional cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to support patient care more holistically.
Certain habits and behaviors can be learned by the way patients interact with conversational AI, which helps improve operational efficiency while reducing overall healthcare costs and reliance on human capital.</p>
