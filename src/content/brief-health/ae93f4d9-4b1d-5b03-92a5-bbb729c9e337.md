    description: >-
      Enlyt was created in order to solve the frustrations with the complexity
      of traditional software development for healthcare - slow, siloed, costly,
      and consistently failing to deliver intended business results. We deeply
      believed we had to fundamentally reshape the way software development was
      thought of, executed, and delivered. Which lead us to creating our leading
      low code platform that helps teams rapidly build modern, scalable, and
      secure healthcare products and services.
