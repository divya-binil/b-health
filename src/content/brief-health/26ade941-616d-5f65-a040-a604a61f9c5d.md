<p>The information that care teams are able to collect and effectively analyze and act on dictates patient satisfaction, experience, and trust.
Mature EHR systems serve as a clearinghouse for patient health data, enabling fast information sharing among providers that enhances care and fosters positive health outcomes.
Rounding out that clinical data with conversational context to enable personalized and familiar care needs to involve more than just information gained in a clinical setting, however.
It’s a mutually beneficial experience: When a provider reaches out ahead of an appointment to confirm and ask for information about preferences, the patient is shown that the provider cares about their experience and their time.
As the number of ways to plug into EHR systems has grown, it’s become possible to unite engagement and clinical data more closely—and do it in a way that’s consistently patient-centered.
Either through back-end integration or apps built specifically for disparate IT systems, providers can centralize and standardize data, creating a complete view of the patient and enabling better care and better decision making.</p>
