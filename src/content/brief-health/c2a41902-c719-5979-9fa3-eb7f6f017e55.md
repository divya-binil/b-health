<p>The timing couldn’t be more critical for us to start making serious headway to reduce the growing problem of burnout among America’s physicians. In 2018, physician burnout was&nbsp;already at an alarming <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/891411">42%</a>,&nbsp;but that number is <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/physician-burnout-emergency-department-design-jefferson-20201229.html">growing</a> as COVID-19 cases surge around the country.&nbsp;</p><p>While we are at a hopeful place in the virus’ trajectory with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/">millions of vaccinations administered</a>, the reality – even once we get through the pandemic – is quite grim for physicians and their workloads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But not everything about the future of a physician’s workload is bleak. We are at a rare and exciting intersection where healthcare industry data that has been accumulating meets computational resources that can handle that data. In the past, we had the data but not the computational resources – at least not those that were affordable and accessible for most physicians and their offices. Technology has been evolving, and innovation has been swift, to get to the point where we can build tools and solutions that a doctor’s office can actually afford and implement without much effort.&nbsp;</p>
