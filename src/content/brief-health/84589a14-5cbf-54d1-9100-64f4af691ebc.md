<p>Leaders from ONC, CMS, CDC and the VA – along with six newly-designated QHIN candidates – gathered on Monday to discuss their visions for data exchange progress in 2023 and beyond. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT and six Qualified Health Information Networks (QHIN) were commended by federal officials on February 13 for their efforts in implementing the 21st Century Cures Act's requirement to establish a nationwide interoperability network. The CommonWell Health Alliance, eHealth Exchange, Epic TEFCA Interoperability Services, Health Gorilla, Kno2, and KONZA received certificates of appreciation from Secretary Xavier Becerra of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for entering the pre-production testing phase of the Trusted Exchange Framework and the Common Agreement. By using the framework, ONC and the Sequoia Project, the TEFCA's acknowledged coordinating entity, hope to create a uniform standard for interoperability across the country, make it easier for institutions to link and securely exchange patient information, and advance public health objectives.</p>
