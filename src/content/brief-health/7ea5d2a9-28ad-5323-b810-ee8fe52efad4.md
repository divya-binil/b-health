<p>The development of larger businesses like Amazon, Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens could put pressure on the traditional healthcare sector. Despite the fact that telehealth use has decreased from pandemic highs, consumerization dynamics and competition from new retailers may have an increasing effect on the healthcare sector, according to a Trilliant Health analysis. According to the 2022 Trends Shaping the Health Economy report, telehealth visits peaked at 73.7 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared to 46.4 million in the first quarter of this year. In contrast, in 2021, only around half of telehealth patients had more than one visit. In the past year, between one and four visits were made by 80% of patients.&nbsp;</p>
