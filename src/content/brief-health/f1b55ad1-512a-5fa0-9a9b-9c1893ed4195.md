<p>In examining more than two dozen of the largest pharma companies from the perspective of how they use digital solutions we now have some conclusions.<br><br>One is how they relate to patients through digital therapeutics, and the other is how they cooperate with technology companies in order to become more successful in the market.
It stands out in its importance as pharmaceutical companies see this as a new technology capable of altering their approach to patients and customers.
It is evident that tech companies have the ability to create tools and solutions people would actually want to use.
I see the future in the actual collaboration between pharma and big tech: technological companies provide technologies that people like, can use and appreciate; and drug makers add their knowledge and content, experience and evidence-based background.</p>
