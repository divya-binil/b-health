<p>Kaiser Permanente is now the fourth organizing member of Graphite Health, which aims to enable a secure and open digital health tool marketplace through the establishment of an interoperable data platform.
"By joining Graphite Health now, we are excited to help shape the future of digital health transformation, and to improve patient and member experience at Kaiser Permanente and beyond," Adams added.
"That's why we are thrilled to add Kaiser Permanente to Graphite Health's growing list of member systems." &nbsp;
