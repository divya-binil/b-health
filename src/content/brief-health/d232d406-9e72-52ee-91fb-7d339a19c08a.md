<p>Zero trust is a significant factor in mitigating ransomware’s effects, along with multifactor authentication. Zero trust is so useful because it requires healthcare organizations to be able to identify new types of users. Typically, there are at least 15 devices connected to any hospital bed in the United States today. There is thus a variety of both people and devices collecting, generating, and curating data across organizations to help with data-driven decision-making. These connected people and things create challenges about how organizations catalog and identify all people, devices, and applications in their networks.</p>
