<p>Vaccine enthusiasm may have waned in recent months, with vaccine hesitancy prevalent among those who are reluctant to get COVID-19 shots. But when the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson vaccines were first approved for emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, Americans rushed to get inoculated, which initially created challenges when it came to vaccine supply and distribution.</p><p>Now, with vaccines in ample supply and Americans cooling to the idea of getting their shots, it seems as though the crush of demand has abated. But the future of the ongoing pandemic is still uncertain, and there are future pandemics to consider as the nation and its healthcare system eye ways to better overcome distribution challenges.</p>
