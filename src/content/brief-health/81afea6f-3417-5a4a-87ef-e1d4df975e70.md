<p>Cadence today announced a partnership with ScionHealth to implement a remote care management and responsive virtual care program across ScionHealth’s national footprint, enhancing clinical care for thousands of patients managing chronic conditions. “Our partnership with Cadence will allow us to seamlessly extend care from our community-based hospitals and our long-term acute care hospitals to patients at home, both expanding access and improving the quality of care for patients managing chronic conditions.”
“Our partnership with Cadence offers consistent, proactive monitoring outside of the clinic, enabling early interventions if and when necessary to improve a patient’s overall health and wellbeing,” said Dr. Dean French, Chief Medical Officer at ScionHealth.
Cadence’s remote patient intervention solution couples powerful new technology with clinical excellence, providing its patients a precise and personal level of care all outside of the four walls of the hospital.</p>
