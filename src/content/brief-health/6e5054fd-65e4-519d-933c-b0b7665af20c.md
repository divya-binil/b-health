<p>A new revenue cycle management (RCM) tool named Advata Smart ARTM is being released by Advata, a business that develops innovative healthcare analytics software. Healthcare providers can enhance accounts receivable (AR) administration by automating processes and informing employees of the best course of action with this unique software as a service (SaaS) solution. The ability of the technology to search through and analyse vast amounts of previous claim data makes AR teams more effective, especially when they are short-staffed. Built on a foundation of industry knowledge, Smart AR uses predictive analytics to optimise staff time and streamline procedures. To analyse AR projects and direct teams on next actions, the system integrates robotic process automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence (AI).&nbsp;</p>
