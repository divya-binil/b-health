<p>CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AVIA, the nation's leading healthcare digital transformation partner, released findings from an industry-first Digital Benchmarking Initiative, delivering critical primary research data sourced from the country's most digitally progressive health systems.
The digital benchmarking survey data reveals trends in patient access, engagement, and virtual care delivery, and identifies opportunities for healthcare organizations to optimize in critical areas such as telehealth, online scheduling, and patient portal utilization.
As the leader in healthcare transformation through digital, AVIA is committed to developing sophisticated metrics to measure progress, identify gaps, and prove impact of digital to support health systems’ strategic roadmaps.
AVIA partnered with digital leaders from progressive health systems to define standards for foundational metrics to enable modern, consumer-centric experiences and measure digital front door performance. Leading health systems, such as NorthShore - Edward-Elmhurst Health (previously Edward-Elmhurst Health), Sentara Healthcare, and St. Luke’s University Health Network, participated in the digital benchmarking to track patient engagement with online scheduling platforms, patient portals, and virtual care offerings.
"Digital transformation is integral to our overall business strategy, and like many other healthcare organizations, we have looked predominantly to other industries to identify success metrics," said Jennifer Bollinger, Senior Vice President of Consumer Strategy at Ochsner Health.</p>
