<p>The goal of the new partnership, he said, is to "decentralize the high concentration of technology [and] regulatory expertise" from some leading health systems across the U.S., and use it to develop guidelines to help other organizations make smarter decisions.
Duke has been in touch with Mayo Clinic for about 18 months building this initiative, said Sendak.
Working alongside Mayo Clinic, "we, in parallel, had been putting together the internal processes for how to develop, evaluate these types of algorithms, and to inform not just IT decision makers but also clinical leaders for appropriate use of AI software."
"We had reached very similar conclusions and approaches for how to develop and integrate AI software in clinical practice," Sendak said of Duke and Mayo.
He and the firm "have been leaders in the field for many years now, helping commercial entities get adoption and navigate the regulatory process" said Sendak.
The group wants to learn about key best practices and challenges faced by care delivery organizations in deploying healthcare AI said Sendak – with an early focus on three areas: procurement, integration and lifecycle management
"In each of these settings, [we're interested in] seeing how those teams are staffed, how they make decisions, who the stakeholders are – because we want to leverage existing capabilities and processes that exist within health systems."
