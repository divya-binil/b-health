<p>Welcome to Healthcare IT Today Extra Features' weekly edition. A weekly collection of noteworthy news, including product releases, new hires, partnerships, research studies, accolades, sales, and more, will be published here. We can't cover everything that is happening in healthcare IT in our entire articles, but we still want to make sure you are aware of all the most recent developments so you can do your duties more effectively. This issue is a unique dispatch from ViVE 2023's early days. New study findings, goods, and partnerships have all been widely publicised in Nashville. For the community of Healthcare IT Today, we tried to cover as many announcements as we could. You can listen as well.</p>
