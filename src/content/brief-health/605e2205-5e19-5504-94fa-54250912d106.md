<p>On February 18, Dr. Marty Makary published an opinion piece in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/well-have-herd-immunity-by-april-11613669731">Wall Street Journal</a> which struck an unusually optimistic note as to the stage of the American COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; Dr. Makary predicts that based on the current trajectory, COVID-19 will be mostly gone by April, allowing Americans to return to a post-COVID-19 normal life. He notes that in the last few weeks, we have seen a dramatic drop in cases (77 percent drop in six weeks) which has been difficult to explain based on a single factor such as vaccinations or drastically improved adherence to social distancing and masking.</p>
