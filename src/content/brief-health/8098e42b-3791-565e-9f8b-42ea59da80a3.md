<p>From their thoughts on how to craft an effective digital health strategy to hospital at home initiatives to the most overused terms in the health IT field, here are six quotes about the role of innovation in healthcare that hospital and health system executives shared with Becker's Hospital Review in July:
Chief Digital Officer at Bon Secours Mercy Health (Cincinnati).
The way I view the promise of digital health and where, as a society, we have not optimized it yet, is the extension of the actual delivery of great care in the more convenient, connected and consistent forums, so that all participants can be greater contributors and greater receivers of the benefits of this new forum.
Only by doing that will we begin to fulfill the digital health promise.
Senior Vice President and CIO at Yale New Haven (Conn.) Health.
The phrase vastly underrepresents digital technology and the data it generates in support of high quality health services.</p>
