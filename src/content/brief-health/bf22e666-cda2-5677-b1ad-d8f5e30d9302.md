<p>AI is already making an impact in healthcare, but many healthcare institutions are not ready to tap into its full potential.<br><br>In fact, AI is already making invaluable contributions to healthcare, driving innovative projects from genomic testing and drug development to patient data management.
AI is also providing assistance in the day-to-day operations of healthcare institutions, from improved accuracy in diagnosis and dispensing medications more efficiently.
With access to the right data and the right tools to store and analyse said data, AI can transform healthcare across the globe.
As AI continues to drive research and development in healthcare, so too will the volume of data grow exponentially.
When the company’s existing infrastructure failed to keep up with the growing volumes of imaging data and the fast pace of development, Olympus turned to Pure Storage’s all-flash storage performance and AIRI, the industry’s first full-stack AI-ready infrastructure.
As data and AI technologies become increasingly important in healthcare, staff will also have to be equipped with the necessary skill-sets like data analytics to maximise their impact, whether they are doctors or administrators.</p>
