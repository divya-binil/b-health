<p>The healthcare sector could benefit from machine learning in a number of ways, including by accelerating research and development (R&amp;D) timelines, assisting clinical judgements, and encouraging improved patient outcomes. We examine what machine learning is, how it may be used, and where the remaining hurdles are as researchers, physicians, and manufacturers work to integrate it into everyday practise.</p><p>Machine learning is an effective technique that can enhance patient outcomes and lessen socioeconomic inequalities. Applications for machine learning in the healthcare sector include medication discovery, diagnosis, and treatment response prediction. Although applying machine learning to healthcare has many benefits, leaders must handle a number of issues, such as data quality, data privacy and security, regulation, and prejudice.</p>
