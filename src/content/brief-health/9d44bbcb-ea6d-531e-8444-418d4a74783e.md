<p>Inovalon, a leading provider of cloud-based software solutions empowering data-driven healthcare, has achieved its 22nd year of NCQA HEDIS® Measure Certification (MY2022), remaining the market leader in quality reporting and the vendor most selected by NCQA as a beta test partner.
Inovalon’s software supports a variety of programs key to a health plan’s success for NCQA’s annual reporting of HEDIS measures used in CMS’ Medicare Advantage Health Plan Star Ratings, NCQA Accreditation programs, HHS’ ACA Marketplace Quality Ratings System, payer value-based contracts, and state Medicaid public reporting programs. Additionally, to help customers comply with NCQA’s new race and ethnicity stratification for five HEDIS MY2022 measures supporting Healthy Equity analytics, Inovalon introduced a race and ethnicity data enrichment software offering earlier this year.
“Differentiated by the speed and sophistication of our cloud software platform, the breadth of our healthcare ecosystem connectivity, and the analytical impact enabled by our massive primary source dataset, Inovalon’s payer software solutions proudly serve as the leading choice for more than 80% of the nation’s clinical quality reporting health plan membership population, including more than 100 health plans, and 24 of the top 25 health plans by patient membership count.”</p>
