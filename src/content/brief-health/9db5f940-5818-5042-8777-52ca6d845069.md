<p>Clinical Evidence Manager aims to streamline the entire research process, and ultimately shorten the cycle between the identification of clinical problems and the implementation of clinical solutions based on the latest medical evidence.
The expert solution streamlines the literature review and evidence appraisal process with artificial intelligence (AI), increases communication and collaboration among departments and facilitates decisions on implementation.
“Evidence-based research initiatives at health systems hold the key to better patient outcomes and financial performance, but these programs are time-intensive making it difficult to efficiently surface and implement new evidence into clinical practice,” said Vikram Savkar, Senior Vice President &amp; General Manager, Medicine Segment, Health Learning, Research &amp; Practice business at Wolters Kluwer.</p>
