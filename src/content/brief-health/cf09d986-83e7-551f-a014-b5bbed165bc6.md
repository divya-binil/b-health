<p>In announcing the deal, Larry Ellison, Oracle's cofounder, chairman and CTO, said it would "provide our overworked medical professionals with a new generation of easier-to-use digital tools that enable access to information via a hands-free voice interface to secure cloud applications."
As for the Oracle-Cerner deal specifically, Springmann said she was "surprised perhaps about the specific timing, but not the announcement itself."&nbsp;</p>
