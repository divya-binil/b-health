title: Surescripts teams up with CDC, providers to accelerate COVID-19 case reporting
---

Surescripts has teamed up with public health officials and laboratories to accelerate case reporting on COVID-19 cases.

The electronic prescribing company has rolled out a clinical direct messaging service to support electronic case reporting (eCR) of coronavirus and other infectious diseases to the public health surveillance systems.

The service replaces the often burdensome manual process of reporting diseases to public health agencies.
