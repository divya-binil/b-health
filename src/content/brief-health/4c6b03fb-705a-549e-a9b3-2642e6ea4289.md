<p>Two years ago, Banner Health unified its patient engagement strategies into one platform, a digital approach that became a necessity when COVID-19 vaccinations became available.
After the Pfizer vaccine was first approved in December 2020, Banner Health was designated as a Vaccine Delivery Help Center.
Operations were launched in two days, using Luma Health's engagement platform that was already in place at the health system, according to Jeff Johnson, vice president of Innovation and Digital Business at Banner Health, headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona.
"On the vaccine front it was a huge opportunity," Johnson said.
Digital outreach reminded patients of their vaccination appointments, which reduced no-shows.
Beyond COVID-19 vaccinations, the new digital strategies are allowing the healthcare provider to change care delivery because the technology is no longer siloed, according to Johnson.
The platform helped deploy telehealth to all Banner Health providers.
"Every one of our Banner physicians is able to conduct telehealth visits," Johnson said.
The reduction in no-show rates was partly a result of engaging the patient, Johnson said.</p>
