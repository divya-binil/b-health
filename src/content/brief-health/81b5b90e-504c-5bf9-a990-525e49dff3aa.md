<p>The healthcare industry has expanded significantly in recent years, in part because the global pandemic highlighted how crucial healthcare is on a global scale. Investors seeking to support ambitious companies in the field have therefore increased their attention. In 2021, the private equity sector alone invested over 151 billion dollars in healthcare globally, more than double what was done the year before. The need for ambitious, rapidly expanding healthcare enterprises is at an all-time high, and medtech and medical devices are two industries that continue to draw outside capital. A sector with aspiration is medtech. Technology remained essential to keeping firms flexible and paving the stage for future transformation as the pandemic caused a shift in customer behaviour across several industries.&nbsp;</p>
