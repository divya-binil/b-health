<p>The dental sector is undergoing a period of tremendous change as a result of unheard-of circumstances such COVID-19's effects, the pace of technological advancement, rising inflation, a tightening labour market, and an ageing population in need of more dental services. A new white paper from the Association of Dental Support Organizations (ADSO) focuses on this shift and outlines four major trends that we predict will have an impact on the dental sector in 2023 and the years following. The growing recognition that dental health has a significant impact on general health was covered by panellists in a recent webinar given by the ADSO titled "A Conversation on Wages, Workforce, and the Economy." Recent research have linked chronic conditions including diabetes and poor dental health.&nbsp;</p><p>There have been several developments in dental IT in recent years. Some of the most significant trends include:</p><ul><li>Electronic health records (EHRs): Many dentists are transitioning from paper records to electronic health records, which can be accessed and updated easily and securely. EHRs can also be integrated with other dental software, such as appointment scheduling and billing systems.</li><li>Dental practice management software: This type of software helps dentists manage the day-to-day operations of their practice, including appointment scheduling, patient communication, billing, and inventory management.</li><li>Digital imaging: Digital x-rays, intraoral cameras, and other digital imaging technologies are becoming increasingly common in dental offices. These technologies can help dentists diagnose and treat patients more effectively and efficiently.</li><li>Teledentistry: Teledentistry refers to the use of telecommunication technologies, such as video conferencing, to provide dental care remotely. This can be useful for patients who live in rural areas or have mobility issues, as it allows them to receive care without having to physically visit a dental office.</li><li>Dental CAD/CAM systems: Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems are used to design and create custom dental restorations, such as crowns and bridges. These systems can help dentists provide more accurate and efficient care to their patients.</li></ul>
