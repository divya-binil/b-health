Bedrock MSO provides comprehensive support for seniors and those with chronic health needs from 33 locations across seven states. They will use CareCloud Remote to support their exercise physiology program to provide patients with flexible, personalized, care at home.</p> <p>For many seniors and those with chronic care needs, the ability to receive care from home is important for continuity of care, improving fitness, and maintaining good health. For providers of these services, CareCloud Remote is a solution that can be leveraged in home healthcare settings to help manage operations, streamline patient scheduling, and get ahead on referrals. Bedrock MSO will use CareCloud Remote to further streamline its home healthcare services in specific areas of revenue cycle management, referral management and credentialing, patient communications, tracking and scheduling, and patient feedback routing.</p> <p>“Seniors and patients with chronic care needs can’t always come to the doctor’s office, due to inconvenience, lack of transportation or scheduling conflicts. For at-home rehab to be successful, providers need access to digital tools that can seamlessly manage referrals, schedule patients instantly, and achieve data transparency throughout the process,” said Karl Johnson, President, CareCloud FORCE. “As an existing CareCloud client, Bedrock MSO turned to us to bridge the digital gap between in-clinic services and home healthcare services for its exercise physiology patients. CareCloud Remote will allow them to manage patient care from a more holistic standpoint.”</p> <p>“We have been very happy with the results we’ve achieved to date in utilizing CareCloud to support patient care. It was an easy decision to extend the use of their digital offerings to help our senior and chronic care patients get the same level of care at home,” said Gloria Berwick, VP of Operations, Bedrock MSO.</p> <p>For more information about CareCloud Remote, visit the website <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TLiviBhPndN8PJVX6Tp3LA1jDKs9O1QsP05oBDlhcRlte-mUIUse36DpgD-K0mQ41rWG6lJpsqLxf3uCf9O_Tw==" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>About CareCloud</strong></p> <p>CareCloud (Nasdaq: MTBC, MTBCO, MTBCP) brings disciplined innovation to the business of healthcare.
