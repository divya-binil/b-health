Healthcare data is key to generate value by unlocking meaningful insights that can help transform healthcare systems and patient care. Today we speak with Maximilian Groth of Decentriq, and Asad Preuss-Dodhy of Roche Diagnostics, to discuss how organizations can make sensitive data their new competitive advantage if data privacy, security, and trust are kept top of mind. There is tremendous value in healthcare data through the insights it can generate.

Having a dedicated digital health arm with expertise in healthcare delivery and data analytics to generate the insights that can make a real impact in patient care. To generate that evidence, you not only need access to healthcare data, but you also need a large amount of data over a wider population. There are 7 ways healthcare executives can generate or utilize value from the data they already have. Trust can go a long way with the data subjects, not just in the clinical setting but also in the future when more healthcare moves out of the hospitals. We need to ensure that the actual use of the data is not causing any harm to the patients in the long term. The consent to use the patientâ€™s data needs to be clear and transparent to build trust the more specific, for example for medical research, the better. As patients demand more and more control of their healthcare data, having these options of what kind of secondary use they would like to allow fully transparent, easy to understand, and flexible, could help to build trust in the long run.
