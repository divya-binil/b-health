<p>King’s College Hospital and Queen Mary University of London have developed an AI algorithm to classify drugs on their efficiacy in treating liver cancer.<br><br><strong>Researchers at King’s College Hospital and Queen Mary University of London have developed an AI algorithm which can prescribe the most effective treatment plan for patients diagnosed with primary liver cancer.</strong></p><p>The computer-based algorithm, named Drug Ranking Using Machine Learning (DRUML), classifies drugs used to treat bile duct cancer (a type of primary liver cancer), based on their efficacy in reducing cancer cell growth.</p><p>The <a href="https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2021/09/21/0008-5472.CAN-21-0955.full-text.pdf">research into DRUML was recently published in Cancer Research</a>, an American Association of Cancer Research journal. Researchers say that the software could be used in the future to predict individual patient responses to therapies to enable them to select the most effective treatment plan.</p><p>Professor Pedro Cutillas, researcher at Queen Mary University of London, said: “Patients who are diagnosed with primary liver cancer often have a very poor prognosis. Cancers of the bile duct, in particular, exhibit great variation in their protein expression and characteristics from patient to patient. This variation results in patients displaying different responses to therapy. Hence why a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment is not the most effective way to reduce cancer cell growth and why we applied DRUML to this type of cancer.”</p>
