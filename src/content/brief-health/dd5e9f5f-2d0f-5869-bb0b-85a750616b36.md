Health Information Technology  (HIT) is huge in the healthcare industry. Times are changing and so are the ways we record patient data. Nowadays, it's not uncommon to be at the doctor's office spending at least 10 minutes going through questions you most likely have gone over and over before. Scenarios where one doctor is not enough, and you find yourself in a new place, the repetition of answering the same questions becomes tiresome. Having been in and out of doctor visits as well as having worked in health care, it is safe to say that we are lacking in certain aspects when it comes to technology and its advances. Us at Renew Bariatrics, want to share a personal viewpoint on somethings our writer, Eula Fullerton, has experienced as a healthcare employee and current patient at the bone and joint unit, for her hip.
