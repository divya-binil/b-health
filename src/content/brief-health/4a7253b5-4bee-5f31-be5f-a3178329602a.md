<p>COVID-19 has placed an enormous amount of strain on hospitals, providers and patients – on top of the stress they were already under! In this guest post, Patty Riskind, head of healthcare &amp; life sciences at a provider of experience management (XM) software, explains how XM software can be used by hospitals to benefit both patients and providers.</p><p>Even prior to COVID-19, patients, and the providers who cared for them, exhibited signs of trauma. In fact, according to consulting firm Prophet, <a href="https://www.prophet.com/patientexperience/the-current-state-of-the-patient-experience.html">81% of patients</a> indicated they were dissatisfied with their healthcare experiences. At the same time, more than half of the country’s physicians and nurses showed significant burnout symptoms, emphasizing how patients and providers alike are feeling the effects of the pandemic.</p><p><a href="http://www.healthcarebusinesstech.com/experience-management-covid-19/">Read on healthcarebusinesstech.com</a></p>
