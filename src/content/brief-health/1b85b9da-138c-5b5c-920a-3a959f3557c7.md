<p>The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation has designed a new model aimed at improving cancer care for Medicare patients through enhanced services such as patient navigation, care planning and the collection of electronic patient-reported outcomes.
It was designed to test how to improve healthcare providers' ability to deliver care centered around patients, consider patients' unique needs and deliver cancer care in a way that will generate the best possible patient outcomes, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Oncology practices who participate in EOM can expect to provide patient-focused Enhanced Services, such as 24/7 access to a clinician, patient navigation services, a detailed care plan and screenings for health-related social needs.
It offers an additional payment to participating oncology practices that provide Enhanced Services to patients who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid.
The Enhancing Oncology Model will incentivize participating oncology practices – including those in rural and underserved areas – to improve the provision of high quality, coordinated care that addresses patients' social needs and improves patient and caregiver support.</p>
