<p>YouTube is pairing health experts up with an array of celebrities to talk about COVID-19 vaccines as part of its new public service announcement. This new PSA is born out of a collaboration between&nbsp;YouTube,&nbsp;the Vaccine Confidence Project and the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, and it's focused on providing people with reliable information about COVID-19 immunizations.</p><p>Google's video platform will focus on giving users information about how the vaccine was developed and tested&nbsp;–&nbsp;and&nbsp;what users can expect post-vaccination. As part of the new initiative, the company will run videos on its own platform, paid TV, radio and social media through July.</p><p>"Hearing inaccurate information can breed doubt in someone’s mind, and that’s why trusted scientific and medical organizations are partnering with YouTube to make sure credible information is reaching people in accessible and culturally relevant ways," Dr. Garth Graham, director and global head of Healthcare and Public Partnerships at YouTube, <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/covid-19-vaccines-get-back-what-you-love/">wrote in a blog post</a>.</p><p>According to YouTube, the PSA will zero in on the 18 to 34 demographic. Graham said the PSA will highlight "diverse voices who bring unique perspectives and experiences." For example, the company pairs up Grammy Award-winning artist MONICA with White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci to talk about vaccines and COVID-19.</p>
