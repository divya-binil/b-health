<p>The advent of fully artificial intelligence, Stephen Hawking said in 2014, "may mean the end of the human race.... It would launch independently and redesign itself at an accelerating rate. Artificial intelligence (AI) has made great strides in recent years, and it has the potential to significantly alter a wide range of facets of human life. It continues to permeate everyday consumer life more deeply. Even if AI may not yet spell the end of humanity as we know it, the envelope is being pushed. AI is assimilating itself into the patient-clinician connection in healthcare, where human interaction is crucial, at an astounding rate. Modern technologies are rapidly demonstrating their capacity to extract meaning from massive volumes of data.</p>
