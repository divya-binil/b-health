<p>While many states in the Northeast, which experienced horrific, medical system-straining COVID-19 outbreaks in early spring, seemed to have the pandemic under control for a while, the insidious disease’s ongoing march continues.</p><p>Fortunately, we have more knowledge regarding disease transmission patterns, and new treatment protocols have proven to be effective. In preparing for the second wave, the medical community – from doctors’ offices to hospitals and government agencies – should immediately prioritize investments in innovative technologies that have been developed specifically to ensure the system is better prepared to handle a heavy volume of cases. These investments will allow new treatments and protocols to do their part in combating COVID-19.</p><p>Three areas of focus for technology investment should be contact tracing, management of foot traffic and crowding, and resource stewardship.</p>
