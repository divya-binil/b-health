<p>And although electronic health records – a frequently cited contributor to burnout in other studies – certainly made the list of culprits, clinicians also pointed to chaotic workplaces, after-hours workloads and too many bureaucratic tasks as major factors.
Meanwhile, physicians are increasingly likely to point to a chaotic work environment as a cause for burnout, while nurses are now more apt to blame after-hours workloads than they were before COVID-19.
"For physicians, there are some specific contributors that are now more indicative that a specific physician is experiencing a higher degree of burnout: after-hours workload, personal control over workload, number of bureaucratic tasks and chaotic workplace," said the report's authors.
"All clinician types – including both physicians and nurses – are reporting higher levels of burnout than ever before," wrote KLAS report authors.</p>
