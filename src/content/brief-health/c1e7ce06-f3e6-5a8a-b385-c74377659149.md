We are living in an extraordinary time in health care. Amid unsustainable rising health care costs that did not deliver commensurate value or quality of care, a remarkable transformation in health care payment was put in motion over the past decade. A proliferation of new payment models is now underway, with an estimated 25 percent of payments across commercial, Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage plans meeting the Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network’s (HCP-LAN) definition of value-based alternative payment models (APM) in 2016. There are at least 840 accountable care organization (ACO) contracts across the nation (more than half established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS]), 11,000 primary care practice sites earning National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) patient-centered medical home (PCMH) recognition, and a proliferation in the design and deployment of episode-based (bundled) payment models.
