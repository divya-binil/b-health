<p>Also, IVF clinic FertilTree is adopting an AI assistive tool for embryo selection by Embryonics.<br><br>Docty targets to set up 100 telehealth kiosks in three Indian states</p><p>Telehealth firm Docty has disclosed its plan to open 100 digital health kiosks across the states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra over the next six months.</p><p>The company aims to improve healthcare access in rural and impoverished urban communities through its Gali Gali Mein Digital Clinic initiative, which currently operates in over 20 locations.</p><p>Aiming to launch in 100 more sites, Docty has partnered with over a hundred offline stores, local pharmacies, photo-copy centres, and internet cafes to launch its kiosks where patients can access online consultations with doctors and receive prescriptions. The kiosks also offer discounted medicines and lab services. &nbsp;</p><p>According to a news report, its strategy is to set up its kiosks every three kilometres in cities and five km. in villages, targetting high-density areas.</p><p>Rural India currently lacks qualified professionals, digital infrastructure, and technology literacy to support digital health, according to Docty co-founder Ramya Subramanian. &nbsp;</p><p>In order to deliver the benefits of digital health to people living in such areas, Docty has acknowledged the need to establish local support centres through a one-stop integrated platform.</p><p>"Additionally, Doctyâ€™s digital health kiosks will also be significant in reducing digital illiteracy in India," Subramanian added.</p>
