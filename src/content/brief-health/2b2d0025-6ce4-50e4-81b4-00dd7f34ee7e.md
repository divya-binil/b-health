<p>Despite the fact that we haven't made many substantial strides in AI research recently, there seems to be a general sense of doom and gloom surrounding AI everywhere we turn. The main difference is that the subject has gained significant attention over the past several months as a result of ChatGPT. Major tech companies and moguls call for a six-month moratorium on the development of large language models (though it's clear that countries like China won't halt their progress), countries ban it, and Silicon Valley has split into factions. Figures like Tristan Harris sow fear. Harari claims that this is even worse than nuclear war. With ChatGPT's quick development and quick accumulation of over 100 million members, there is considerable concern about what the future may bring.</p>
