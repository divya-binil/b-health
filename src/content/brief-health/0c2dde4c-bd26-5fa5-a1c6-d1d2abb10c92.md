<p>Abbott's Curt Blythe, Medtronic's Matt Russo and MITRE's Matt Weir discuss security across the product life cycle, how to get support from device company leadership – and how you can become a device tester. Medical device advances have improved patient care and advanced healthcare, but they also give healthcare organisations a wide assault surface. Medical device product security professionals were welcomed by NETSpi, a security service provider, to discuss the business and difficulties of protecting connected technologies in healthcare. They discussed issues such as developing product security teams, information sharing across teams across the product lifecycle, regulatory changes affecting the industry, and methods for expanding the talent pipeline. No matter where product security teams are located, they must be collaborators in product development, according to Matt Russo, senior director of product security at Medtronic, Curt Blythe, director of product security at Abbott, and Matt Weir, principal cybersecurity engineer at MITRE.</p>
