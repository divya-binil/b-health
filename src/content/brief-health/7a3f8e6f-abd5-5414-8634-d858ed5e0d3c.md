<p>The Digital and Technology Partners department at Mount Sinai Health System announced on March 16 that it is collaborating with The New York Public Library to hold free classes called ‘Take Charge with MyChart,’ in an effort to expand equitable healthcare. According to a news release from March 16, the Mount Sinai Health System's Digital and Technology Partners (DTP) division and The New York Public Library (NYPL) are working together to improve access to telehealth services and digital literacy abilities. This initiative attempts to increase access to fair healthcare in New York City. According to the press release, "The Library's TechConnect department will hold free classes called 'Take Charge with MyChart,' which teach participants how to use MyMountSinai, Mount Sinai's version of MyChart, a software system and app that is widely used by healthcare organisations, to find a new doctor, access existing medical records or test results, schedule or attend a virtual doctor's appointment, and refill prescriptions online."</p>
