<p>Today, medical associations, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), Independent Physician Associations (IPAs), medical groups, and home health care agencies will be able to obtain automated prior authorization thanks to a partnership between Edifecs, Inc., a provider of global health information technology solutions, and Empowered-Home. With virtual care management at its core, Empowered-Home has added Edifecs' prior authorization solution to its special partner ecosystem to support ACOs, IPAs, and health plans in achieving clinical and financial success as the industry shifts to distant value-based care. The foundation of the ecosystem of Empowered-Home is made up of the Edifecs prior authorization solution and the clinical decision support system of Privis Health, a provider of patient management software. Both payers and providers find the prior authorization process to be time-consuming and expensive. We have made great efforts to automate that burden.</p>
