    description: >-
      ChronWell was formed in 2017 by the team that built the largest
      Gastroenterology information technology platform in the US with the vision
      to change Workers Compensation by spending the right amount of time on the
      simple things that can help injured workers and patients take giant leaps
      forward.


      The company eventually developed a unique and dynamic platform that
      tracked the progress of an injury from the initial point in which a worker
      was injured through return to work.  This lead to a revolutionary Early
      Intervention program that has helped reduce costs, track injuries and
      assist in appropriate reporting.
