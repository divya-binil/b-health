<p>Drug development platform Quris raised another $9 million, and PharmStars is accepting applications for its accelerator cohort focused on women's health and health equity. Heal, a business providing telehealth and primary care at home, is preparing to lay off employees. WARN letters stated that Heal would eliminate 60 workers in New York City and 182 positions in Los Angeles County. A firm representative informed MobiHealthNews that the business is actively in talks with prospective purchasers and that it is required to notify the states of New York and California of any potential impending layoffs. Heal announced its expansion with Cigna Medicare Advantage participants in Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, and South Carolina before the end of October. In 2020, the startup received $100 million from insurer Humana. The recent round of employment losses at digital health startups included Heal's layoffs.</p>
