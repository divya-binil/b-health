<p>A spokeswoman at Cerebral stated that the organization-wide clinical quality and safety were prioritised while the layoffs were "focused primarily on realising operational efficiency." According to information from the Wall Street Journal, troubled digital mental health company Cerebral will let go of around 20% of its workforce as it restructures its operations. The company's headquarters, clinical care staff, and support staff will all be impacted, according to a memo from CEO Dr. David Mou that was examined by the WSJ. A spokeswoman for Cerebral stated that the company's "ongoing transformation effort" is what led to the layoffs. Over the past few months, Cerebral has come under a tonne of criticism and unfavourable headlines, particularly on its prescription policies for banned narcotics.</p>
