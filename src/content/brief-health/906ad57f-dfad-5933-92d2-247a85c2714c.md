<p>These collaborations – while never exactly kept in secret – are not mapped out, so it is almost impossible to form a picture if it is a growing trend or what kinds of healthcare providers the tech giants cooperate with.
These were the driving question behind the latest project of our data analysts when they started mapping out how tech giants collaborate with hospitals and what it means in terms of sharing data.
Tech giants have vast experience in developing user-friendly technologies that actually find their way to the mainstream – an important factor as healthcare is becoming ever-more tech-focused.
The infographic includes the partners – the tech giant and the healthcare collaborator -, the scope of the cooperation, whether it is finished or ongoing (a significant majority belongs to the latter), and the country where it happens.
All Tech Giants are involved in at least one collaboration, and most of these focus either on A.I.
These collaborations are exciting from the futuristic point of view, and we will continue to cover what tech giants do in healthcare and will follow up on these (and new) cooperations.</p>
