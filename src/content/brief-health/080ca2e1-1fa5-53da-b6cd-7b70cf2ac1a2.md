<p>The New Year brings hope and promises that an end to the <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/coronavirus-covid-19/">COVID-19 pandemic</a> is in sight. With two vaccines authorized by the FDA for emergency use, and close to 3 million healthcare workers already vaccinated, there is hope that this virus will be eradicated and life will begin to return to normal by yearâ€™s end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, for the frontline healthcare workers still treating escalating case volumes, the physical and emotional toll is devastating. With another surge forecasted for early 2021, having the additional burden of answering questions about the vaccine, distribution prioritization, second dose compliance, potential side effects, and consideration of allergic reaction risk is unmanageable.&nbsp;</p><p>While the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine is undeniably good news, timely and effective vaccine communication calls for swift action on the part of hospital administrators and clinicians as they navigate a fragmented and concerning response by government agencies to ensure its successful deployment and avoid placing further stress on already overburdened and exhausted healthcare workers.</p>
