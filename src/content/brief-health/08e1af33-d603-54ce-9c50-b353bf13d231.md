title: What healthcare issues are driving voters to the polls on Election Day?
---

The COVID-19 pandemic has uprooted voters' lives and may shape the way they cast their ballots Tuesday.

Some eight months in, the novel coronavirus has so far killed more than 230,000 Americans, with cases rapidly rising as flu season begins. Earlier failures containing its spread led to a patchwork of local lockdowns spurring job losses, business closures and now a recession.

While some early polling though suggests economic issues might be a stronger driver in who shows up to vote, healthcare issues, from the pandemic to insurance coverage via Medicaid and for pre-existing conditions are also top of mind.
