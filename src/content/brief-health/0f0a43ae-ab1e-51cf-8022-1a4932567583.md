<p>Colorectal cancer is a devastating disease. As of 2019, it was the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/research/update-on-cancer-deaths/index.htm">second leading cause of cancer death</a> among all U.S. adults. This year, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is expected to adopt new <a href="https://uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/draft-recommendation/colorectal-cancer-screening3">recommendations</a> for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening which will lower the age of screening from 50 to 45, due in part to the alarming rise in CRC incidence among people under age 50 (<a href="https://ascopost.com/issues/june-25-2019/solving-the-mystery-of-why-colorectal-cancer-is-on-the-rise-in-young-adults/">up 51% since 1994</a>).</p><p>While the data supports lowering the age for screening, it also creates an unfortunate log jam for our medical groups and health systems.</p><p>Our national goal for screening patients is 80%, but current data shows that we are behind the national average by more than 10%. Furthermore, data from AMGA’s <a href="https://www.amga.org/performance-improvement/best-practices/collaboratives/collaborative-for-performance-excellence/clinical-quality-and-safety/">Collaborative for Performance Excellence</a> shows a significant decrease in the overall volume for CRC screening due to the impact of COVID-19 on practice operations.</p>
