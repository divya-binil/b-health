title: Security researchers expose new Alexa and Google Home vulnerability
---

Security researchers with SRLabs have disclosed a new vulnerability affecting both Google and Amazon smart speakers that could allow hackers to eavesdrop on or even phish unsuspecting users. By uploading a malicious piece of software disguised as an innocuous Alexa skill or Google action, the researchers showed how you can get the smart speakers to silently record users, or even ask them for the password to their Google account.
