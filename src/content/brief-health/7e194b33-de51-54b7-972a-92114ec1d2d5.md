<p>A growing need for digital transformation and transitions to remote work have fueled technological innovation during the past two years.

Implementing, executing, and operationalizing AI platforms across these groups' networks successfully is a crucial step they may take to progress modernization and enhance their practises. Because they are worried about safety and accuracy, many healthcare officials are reluctant to adopt new technologies.</p>
