<p>There are two types of innovation.</p><p>First, there’s innovation in the underlying technology, tools or components that can be used to do something. Let’s call it <i>local innovation</i>. This ussually starts as experimentation with new ways of doing things just to see if it’s possible… to see what happens. It does not start with a specific problem and can be completely fueled by curiosity and a sense of wonder. Local innovation is important because it creates new opportunities that didn’t exist before. However, it is not the type of innovation that leads to real change in the world and we can get into trouble when we pretend that it is.</p><p>Second, there’s innovation in the way we actually do our jobs. Let’s call this <i>systems innovation</i>. Systems innovation must start with a problem that needs to be solved. The problem, or current state, is clearly defined and the cost to the system is well known. The desired state is also well defined, and we at least have a plan for how we will measure and prove success. The real work, and therefore real systems innovation, occurs between the current and desired state. And that’s what we’re here to talk about today.</p>
