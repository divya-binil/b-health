<p>Remember when internet advertising was in its infancy and every site you clicked on released a barrage of pop-ups? At first it must have seemed like this trend was the next big thing and would help brands reach tons of buyers. However, the irritation factor could not be ignored. Sure, consumers were seeing the products, but they were not ready to buy!</p><p>Savvy brands have become wiser since those early days and realized that pop-ups fall short of their intended goal. After all, no one cares to see ads for Burger King when they’re trying to find a new raincoat online.</p><p>The same is true for healthcare brands. If you’re trying to find out what to do about your recent diabetes diagnosis, you don’t need to know (and probably don’t even want to think about) who the leading cancer care specialist in your area is. It’s important that patients or potential patients are receiving the information that they want <i>when they are ready for it.</i></p>
