<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has successfully accelerated the availability of digital health tools, while simultaneously exposing opportunity for improvement in their ability to activate patients in their care. Our nation has struggled to engage patients through patient portal apps over the past decade â€“ indeed, while <a href="https://patientengagementhit.com/news/patient-portal-adoption-tops-90-patient-registrations-lag">over 90% of organizations offer patient portal access, hospitals see fewer than 25% patient adoption</a>. We have the power to reach virtually everyone in the country digitally, but we must ensure their engagement to have a real impact on the health and well-being of our nation.</p>
