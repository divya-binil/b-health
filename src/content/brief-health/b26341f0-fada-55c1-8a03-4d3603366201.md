<p>These characteristics continue to be traits that further separate healthcare IS teams from counterparts in other industries.
Without strong and stable teams, our ability to react to the ever changing environment is virtually impossible.
As a result, our approach is to continue to zero in on the needs of our team members.
Remote work remains viable where possible, broad and consistent communication keeps our associates informed and supported, and providing employees with the opportunity to achieve their professional goals continues to be a winning strategy for most of our staff.
I’m proud to recognize my team and the many others that have risen to the challenge and remain strong throughout this pandemic.</p>
