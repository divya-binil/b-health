<p>Although it is not a large academic medical center, Maryland-based Frederick Health has made considerable progress in integrating genetic test results into its electronic health record for clinicians to take advantage of.
Robert Wack, M.D., former chief medical information officer at Frederick Health and now a consultant, added that at pretty much every medical center, even the big research facilities, the way they ingest any kind of genetic data is on a piece of paper that's got a report from their testing lab.
Meditech is really on the bleeding edge of working with the labs to bring the genetic data that is the result of the testing that's done into the medical record as discrete data.” To understand that what the system says today isn't necessarily what the system's going to say six months from now or six years from now, and that they have to be in constant dialogue with the patient's results and the patient's medical situation, all of that informed by that genetic information that we gathered and is now a permanent part of their electronic medical record.”
I think the clinical decision-making process is going to be improved and curated, so to speak, to each patient, said Kristin Conley, D.O., who succeeded Dr. Wack as chief medical information officer.</p>
