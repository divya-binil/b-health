<p>Software, hardware and innovations in materials have made repeatable, personalized orthotics both possible and exceedingly practical for patients and providers alike.
Cloud-computing solutions combined with 3D printing capabilities have shortened the production process and provided a new level of customization.
But as podiatry clinics and providers resume in-person patient care, recent innovations offer the opportunity to not only make up for lost time but also drastically improve foot pain treatment and outcomes.
With cloud computing software, providers can capture 3D renderings of patients’ feet and create personalized orthotics that meet patients’ exact needs.
Using the 3D scans to identify foot issues, providers can address patient problems in the office and create orthotic designs that specifically solve them.
When patients need or want a new orthotic, providers can simply reorder from the same 3D scan or take a new one if the patients’ foot health or anatomy has changed.</p>
