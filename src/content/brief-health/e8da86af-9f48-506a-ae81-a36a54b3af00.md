<p>The significance of building confidence in artificial intelligence (AI) when it is used as a medical device is highlighted in the essay "The Importance of Trust in AI as a Medical Device" by Alison Dennis, which was released on June 15, 2023. According to the paper, establishing trust with patients and regulatory bodies would be essential for the successful integration of AI into medical devices and diagnostic equipment.</p><p>According to Dennis, it is crucial to make sure that patients have faith and security in the technology being used to diagnose and treat them as AI becomes more pervasive in the healthcare sector. The relationship between a patient and a provider is based on trust, which is even more important when AI is involved.&nbsp;</p>
