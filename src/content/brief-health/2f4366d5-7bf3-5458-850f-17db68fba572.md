<p>In a HIMSS21 session, two experts will weigh in on the importance of using holistic frameworks to shore up cybersecurity.<br><br>Safeguarding patient health information can be extremely difficult, as it necessitates taking inventory of data, finding any vulnerabilities and assessing risk across the board.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Often, experts say, the complexity of mitigating risk is beyond human scale. In an upcoming HIMSS21 panel, Aaron Miri, chief information officer for Dell Medical School and UT Health Austin, and Tausight Founder and CEO David&nbsp;Ting will discuss the importance of operationalizing and automating guidelines around PHI vulnerabilities – and describe real-time methods for protecting that data. &nbsp;</p><p>"Healthcare is a large-scale transactional industry with massive amounts of highly sensitive data and strict regulatory requirements," explained Miri and Ting in a joint interview with <i>Healthcare IT News</i>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>"CISOs and CIOs need to secure clinical workflows when clinicians access and use PHI," they continued. But the volume of PHI data that needs to be protected can be staggering.</p>
