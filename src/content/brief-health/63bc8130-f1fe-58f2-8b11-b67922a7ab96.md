<p>While more than half of the leaders polled say their telehealth experience has been a positive one, they saw some barriers too, including some patients' challenges using the new technologies.</p><p>A new survey of 500 executives in the healthcare industry found that the switch to telehealth necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic has been a largely positive one, and the majority said at least some of the changes would be permanent. &nbsp;</p><p>The survey, conducted by marketing agency Boston Digital and released Monday, found that 57% of executives said telehealth had increased the quality of patient care. But the results weren't all rosy: About a quarter said it had no impact, and 15% said it had decreased the quality of patient care. &nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/majority-health-execs-say-telemedicine-has-improved-patient-care">Read on healthcareitnews.com</a></p>
