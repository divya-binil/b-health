<p>Further, Dr. Ahmed Siddiqi's practice is likely to see upwards of $100,000 in remote therapeutic management reimbursement by the end of 2023 – all while delivering high-quality remote care and making his patients feel well cared for. Early in 2020, Orthopaedic Institute Brielle Orthopaedics orthopaedic surgeon Dr. Ahmed Siddiqi began integrating digital, remote, and hybrid treatment methods. As an orthopaedic surgeon, he was motivated in part by the epidemic but also by the desire to increase patient participation and monitoring after they were sent home for recovery. "Historically, providers have relied on one to three in-person interactions after surgery to understand how their patient is doing rather than having direct and ongoing visibility into patient progress during recovery," he said. Patients must complete a tonne of paperwork in person, bring home a tonne of heavy, confusing educational materials, and take part in multiple sessions of pricey outpatient or home physical therapy, according to the normal post-surgery care regimen.</p>
