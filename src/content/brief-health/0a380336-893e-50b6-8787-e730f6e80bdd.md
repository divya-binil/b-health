<p>In a prospective observational research, PulseAI's algorithm for detecting atrial arrhythmias surpassed the software included with the Apple Watch. Results from PulseAI's algorithm for interpreting electrocardiogram (ECG) data recorded by Watch showed that it outperformed Apple's built-in software in terms of sensitivity and specificity, according to research presented at the Heart Rhythm Conference. The findings were presented as proof that PulseAI's algorithm may enhance patient monitoring by enabling the precise interpretation of smartwatch signals at scale by the company, which collaborates with ECG equipment makers. Dive Insight: The International Trade Commission determined that Apple violated the patents of AliveCor, and the Biden administration upheld the decision, putting Apple's position in the wristwatch ECG monitoring industry in jeopardy. Although AliveCor cautioned the case may result in an import restriction.</p>
