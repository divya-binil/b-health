<p>This chronic condition requires continuous care, and Leon needed a way to ensure continuous care that would work within its existing clinical workflow and align with its mission of providing personalized patient care.
"Leon Medical Centers has always been a leader in patient care using available technology to improve our patients' health," said Lourdes Dapena, director of pharmacy services.
With a focus on patient-centric care and an understanding there is no one-size-fits-all approach to diabetes management, Leon Medical Centers was looking for a platform that would enable more personalized interventions for its highest risk T2D patients.
The platform integrates directly with Leon's Hyperspace Epic EHR, providing clinicians the ability to see a more holistic view of their patients' status within their existing workflow.
The platform pulls in relevant data from the Epic EHR and stratifies patients who are at the highest risk, enabling a focused approach to remote monitoring from the start.
At the beginning of 2020, Leon Medical Centers defined a patient cohort, in this case, any patient with an A1c greater than 9%, uploaded their information into the Rimidi/Smart Meter technology solution and enrolled them in remote patient monitoring, with the goal of reducing their A1c.
"When patients enrolled in either their in-person clinic appointments or virtually, they were given a SmartMeter iGlucose cellular-enabled glucometer and instructed by their doctor how often to take their blood-glucose reading." Dapena said.
"It's important to look for platforms that provide data in real or near-real time to the clinical staff so they can provide timely interventions and communication with the patient," she said.</p>
