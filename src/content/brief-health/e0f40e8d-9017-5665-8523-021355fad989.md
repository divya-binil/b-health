<p>Upliv, a start-up for women's virtual care, will be introduced by Northwell Holdings and Aegis Ventures with the intention of raising the bar for clinical menopause assistance. Employees who are experiencing perimenopause and menopause symptoms will be provided with virtual telemedicine services and whole-person care by Upliv in collaboration with their employers. The Upliv service will initially be made available to a restricted group of nurses at Northwell Health through a trial programme. This will be followed by an anticipated enterprise-wide rollout in the first quarter of 2023. Employees will not be charged anything to use Upliv as an employee benefit. Aegis Ventures and Northwell Holdings, the for-profit investment division of Northwell Health, collaborated to create Upliv.&nbsp;</p>
