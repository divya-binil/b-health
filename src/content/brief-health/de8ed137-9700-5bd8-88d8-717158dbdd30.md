<p>The 20-week program, known as Mayo Clinic Platform_Accelerate, is aimed at giving early-stage health tech AI startups a boost, with additional expert assistance from Google and Epic.
"Health tech startups are critical contributors to the cycle of innovation," said Dr. John Halamka, president of Mayo Clinic Platform, in a statement.
Through the program, participants will delineate AI model requirements with the help of data science experts; check for fairness and bias in their models; access de-identified Mayo Clinic patient data in a secure environment; conduct model validation with guidance from data science experts; and plan clinical validation studies.
The Mayo Clinic has made several pushes toward AI-driven innovation in recent years, as in its ongoing 10-year partnership with Google and the introduction of its Clinical Data Analytics Platform in 2020.</p>
