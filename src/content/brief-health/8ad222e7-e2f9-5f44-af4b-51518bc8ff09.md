<p>A global health crisis has thrust us into a scenario in which lives quite literally depend on the ability to virtually connect. <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/category/technology/telehealth-2/">Telehealth </a>has rapidly emerged as a vital tool, enabling continuity of care, allowing vulnerable individuals to access their physician from home, and freeing up resources for providers to treat the most critical patients. The acceptance of telehealth and expansion of covered services for the senior population demonstrate that this technology will endure long after <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/coronavirus-covid-19/">COVID-19 </a>subsides.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior to the pandemic, just 11% of Americans utilized telehealth compared to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality">46% so far</a> this year, and virtual healthcare interactions are expected to top <a href="https://go.forrester.com/press-newsroom/us-virtual-care-visits-to-soar-to-more-than-1-billion/">1 billion</a> by year’s end. While the technology has been a life-saver for many, usage depends heavily on the availability of audio-video capabilities, internet access, and technological prowess – potentially leaving vulnerable patients behind.</p>
