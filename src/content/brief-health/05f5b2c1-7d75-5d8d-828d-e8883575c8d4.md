<p>When the pandemic hit, healthcare organizations were thrown into reaction mode, with many long-term projects being shelved indefinitely.&nbsp; However, health leaders were able to take some steps which not only addressed some of their current needs but set the stage for future growth.</p><p>That’s been the case for customers of interoperability solutions vendor <a href="https://www.lyniate.com/">Lyniate</a>, which works with laboratories, providers and public health departments in 47 of 50 states. When COVID hit, these entities were faced with massive new demands to share COVID-19 testing data as a reportable disease. The 2 million COVID tests per day these entities had to manage represented a 10-fold increase in reportable to public health departments, according to Lyniate’s Drew Ivan, chief product and strategy officer and Sonal Patel, its chief customer success officer.</p><p>To address this surge, Lyniate customers built out their capacity for data exchange, in part by adding new endpoints for sending and receiving data. At the same time, customers used the interoperability platform to manage communication about negative COVID tests via email, rather than phone calls.</p><p>Another step Lyniate customers took to scale up for the pandemic was to integrate EHRs and billing tools within virtual care with the help of its professional services team. By doing so, they not only dealt with current issues but began to address the long-term need to connect telehealth with other technologies going forward.</p>
