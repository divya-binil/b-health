<p>According to one expert, "from the perspective of the care team, this means less activity but more action, less recording but better documentation, and better coordination but less coordinating." Treatment orchestration has been referred to in the health IT industry as the solution to the EHRs' inconsistent lack of ability to coordinate care for patients and caregivers. Care orchestration is an idea that makes use of a platform to prioritise patients, automate chores, and combine patient records. Care orchestration unifies several data sources into a single source and sorts according to the requirements or requests of physicians. It connects many departments and ambulatory sources, allowing all the care teams to share test findings and imagery. Lumeon, a provider of care orchestration technology, is led by Robbie Hughes.&nbsp;</p>
