<p>Prior to COVID, major technological transformation initiatives were already underway at many clinical trial sites, sponsors, and contract research organizations (CROs.) But the move to decentralized trials accelerated dramatically in 2020 and 2021–and it’s not slowing down.
Survey data from WCG Avoca shows that research sites and sponsors expect 89% of clinical trials to qualify as a hybrid, with a mix of decentralized technology and in-person visits.
As the clinical trial industry evolves, sites, sponsors, and CROs need to leverage a best-of-breed approach to technology solutions.
In 2022, clinical trial organizations will expect their technology partners to work together and have open systems.
With 89% of sponsors and sites using or planning to use hybrid trials, clinical trial organizations have gone from ‘dipping their toe in the water’ to getting ready to jump in!
Instead, sites, sponsors, and technology vendors will work together to focus on participant experience.
Even as we return to normal life, the majority of sites, sponsors, and CROs will continue to use DCTs and patient-centric technology.</p>
