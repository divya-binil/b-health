<p>According to Kristin Kostick-Quenet, PhD, a medical ethicist at Baylor University, medical information from EHRs are exchanged and sold without the knowledge of patients, causing an ethical conundrum as they are left out of the conversation when it comes to where and who has access to their personal health information.
According to Dr. Kostick-Quenet, patients could own an NFT of their medical data.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>
