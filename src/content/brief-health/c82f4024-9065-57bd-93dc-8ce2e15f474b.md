<p>From clinician burnout to nursing staffing shortages, we asked executives share their clinical predictions to watch in 2022 and beyond.<br><br>The nursing shortage will transform how organizations manage Clinical Documentation Improvement (CDI) – With more staff leaving the healthcare field than ever and staffing costs surging as a result, thousands of healthcare CFOs have had to quickly shift their focus from revenue stream creation and optimization to doing more with less.
The burnout crisis will drive significant workflow changes for millions of clinicians – As technology continues to advance and workflows evolve accordingly to facilitate that shift, organizations will begin effectively removing a lot of the discrete frustrations that come together to fuel burnout, and we will see a return of job satisfaction, as well as increased patient satisfaction as a result.
These kinds of clinical surveillance and decision support tools at the point of care are critical as healthcare grapples with ongoing clinician shortages and burnout.
Nurses will continue to demand for better pay and benefits which will cause shortages to worsen if not addressed by facilities.</p>
