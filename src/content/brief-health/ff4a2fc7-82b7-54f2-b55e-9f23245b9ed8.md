<p><i>The industry is adjusting to the pandemic, but FDA approvals could dip this year. Several new drugs for atopic dermatitis may get the agency’s green light.</i></p><p>Like so much else in healthcare and beyond, a large question hangs over drug development in 2021 and the pace of FDA approvals: How much of an effect will COVID-19 have?</p><p>Because the majority of FDA approvals in the latter part of 2020 were based on results of trials conducted before the pandemic, the full impact of the pandemic on approvals may not become evident till this year. When the pandemic reached the United States in March and lockdowns throughout the country began, some active trials paused, many trials set to start were delayed, and new COVID-19-focused trials commenced. In just March and April, 905 clinical trials were suspended as a result of the pandemic, according to a study published in the September 2020 issue of <i>Annals of Surgery</i>. Meanwhile, a slew of others were rapidly launched to assess potential COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.</p>
