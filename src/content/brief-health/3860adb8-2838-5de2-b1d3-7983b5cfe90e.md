<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) finalised the following payment rules for the 2022 calendar year:
Home Health Prospective Payment System (PPS)
CMS increased hospital outpatient services payments by 2% and home health by 2.6%, while reducing physician speciality reimbursement.
PFS also updated clinical labour prices, which benefits primary care physicians while lowering payment to specialities like interventional radiology, vascular surgery, radiation oncology, and cardiology.</p>
