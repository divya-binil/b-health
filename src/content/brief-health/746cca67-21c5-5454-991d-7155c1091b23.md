<p>COVID-19 risk tools to help determine if a patient can be discharged or needs to be admitted to the hospital.<br><br>As <a href="https://www.imedicalapps.com/tag/covid/"><strong>COVID-19 cases</strong></a> continue to rise across the United States, those of us in Emergency Room (ER) managing many of these patients are faced with a difficult decision every shift: “Is this patient okay for discharge?”. We know the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients aged less than 50 with no significant co-morbidities is low — but this jumps multiple fold in subsequent decades of life <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#definitions"><strong>(CDC)</strong></a>. This otherwise healthy patient population of less than 50 with reassuring vital signs is the easiest to manage. They are almost always getting discharged.</p>
