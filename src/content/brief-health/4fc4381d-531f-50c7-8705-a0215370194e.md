    When commercial automobiles became widely available in the early 20th
    century, they resembled horse-drawn wagons. Over time, countless iterations
    were refined to improve style, safety and accessibility.

    These updates didn’t happen in a vacuum. Feedback, legislation,
    experimentation and market competition drove the changes. Diverse
    stakeholders and experiences helped evolve the vehicles that much of
    humanity now relies on for transportation.

    Similarly, diverse voices in healthcare IT are critical to improving tools
    that boost outcomes and reduce disparities in a nation where more than 38
    million people live in poverty — and where communities of color generally
    face more barriers to care.
