<p>Investment in the AI platform on Microsoft Azure could hasten the performance and analysis of multimodal data, leading to better patient outcomes. A new Microsoft alliance intends to accelerate the transition to precision medicine around the world and improve data interoperability with AI and ML. According to the collaboration release, the multiyear project will concentrate on creating and implementing next-generation healthcare solutions that equalise data across silos, improve clinical workflows, and raise standards of care. The biggest and trickiest data sets to structure, analyse, and archive are those related to multimodal health. The data display module for Sophia Genetics makes use of Microsoft Azure services to deliver data curation at scale and offer AI and machine learning capabilities.</p>
