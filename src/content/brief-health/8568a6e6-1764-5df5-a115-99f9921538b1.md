<p>Digital front doors can make the healthcare experience more comfortable and less complicated. However, it is not obvious to make it the right way. Healthcare organisations are increasingly turning to digital front door solutions. I first became interested in the subject when I came across a research that examined how the UK's primary care system may be improved by utilising a novel idea called the "digital front door." My interest peaked, I made the decision to learn more about this subject. I recently made a brief video in an effort to define this trend in less than a minute because it is an idea I have come across more frequently than not and one that is altering how we get healthcare services. But since this occurrence will have a significant impact on healthcare systems in the future, it also merits a more thorough examination.</p>
