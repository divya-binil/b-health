<p>Today at the 108th Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Annual Meeting, Perspectum and Nuance Communications, Inc., a Microsoft company, announced their partnership to deliver at scale Perspectum's integrated digital platform suite for metabolic disease care and management (RSNA Booth #7938). The over 12,000 US healthcare facilities employing Nuance's increasing Precision Imaging NetworkTM will embrace Perspectum's non-invasive quantitative multiparametric MR (Magnetic Resonance) software services more quickly thanks to this new partnership. According to Dr. Michael Rosenblatt, Board Director of Perspectum, "Nuance is a perfect partner to create a new paradigm depicting AI stacked on visuals to give effective and accurate content for consumers from point of read to point of treatment." "The partnership will enable nationwide access to Perspectum's premium decision support products," he continues.</p>
