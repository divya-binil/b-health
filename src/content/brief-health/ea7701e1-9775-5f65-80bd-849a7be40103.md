<p>It is time to be proactive in planning sustainable future responses to community and health emergencies which are inextricably connected. For example, by enabling the availability of virtual and/or AI-powered healthcare services, digitised solutions such as telemedicine, have successfully impacted the primary care model of seeking an appointment, consulting the doctor, accessing lab tests, accomplishing the purchase/delivery of prescription medicine, and shifting care to patient homes. While we aim to build a world-class sustainable healthcare system it would be pertinent to keep the 5s theory in mind: Safety – a place where global standards are met; Savings – getting the same quality or better quality of affordable care; Speed – better quality of life with a shorter waiting time; Service – a place with higher service and Staff – skilled labour. Our concept of sustainability at Aster DM Healthcare is to build a sustainable future by giving back to the societies while defining a path that creates shared values benefitting the organisation, community, and the environment.<br>&nbsp;</p>
