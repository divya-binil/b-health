<p>Over the last several years of my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work with a variety of global medical device manufacturers.&nbsp; Recently, I have also started working with some new organizations that are not yet global in scale.&nbsp; A theme that I have discovered is that these organizations haven’t yet established true ownership for security within the organization, even though there is increasing regulatory pressure for building security, evidenced by updated <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/content-premarket-submissions-management-cybersecurity-medical-devices">FDA guidance</a> and recognition of international standards such IEC 62443, UL 2900, and AAMI TIR 57.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
