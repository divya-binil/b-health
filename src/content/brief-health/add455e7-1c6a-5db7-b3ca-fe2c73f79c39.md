<p>The CIO at a Denver behavioral health center talks about how NLP can help with behavioral health, what it will take to get more providers to adopt the AI technology – and how it can help with managing social determinants data.
Healthcare IT News interviewed Williams to discuss how NLP can help with behavioral health, the mood around NLP in behavioral health, what it will take to get more providers to adopt NLP and how NLP can help with social determinants of health. While NLP could almost certainly help reduce clinician burden and improve outcomes, most providers feel unable to take the time to adopt a new process.
As more irrefutable evidence of the time and cost savings emerges, more behavioral health providers will embrace NLP.
A. NLP can help improve health equity through objective analysis of how staff are following protocols and taking consistent prescribed steps to help people we serve access SDOH drivers such as housing and food.</p>
