  How AI Can Deliver Benefits in Healthcare Manufacturing and Patient Device
  Usage
via: ' '
insights_description: >-
  <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to significantly transform
  the pharmaceutical and medical device markets in several ways:</p><ul><li>Drug
  discovery and development: AI can help identify new drug candidates by
  analyzing vast amounts of data, such as genetic and proteomic information, to
  identify potential targets. This can accelerate the drug discovery process and
  reduce costs.</li><li>Clinical trials: AI can improve the efficiency of
  clinical trials by identifying patients who are most likely to respond to a
  treatment, helping to reduce the time and cost associated with the trial. AI
  can also help to monitor patients during clinical trials and identify any
  adverse events that may occur.</li><li>Personalized medicine: AI can help to
  personalize treatment based on a patient's individual characteristics, such as
  their genetics, medical history, and lifestyle. This can lead to more
  effective treatments and better patient outcomes.</li><li>Medical device
  development: AI can help to design and develop new medical devices by
  analyzing patient data to identify unmet needs and develop solutions to meet
  those needs.</li><li>Disease diagnosis and management: AI can help to improve
  disease diagnosis and management by analyzing medical images and other patient
  data to identify patterns and provide more accurate diagnoses and treatment
  recommendations.</li></ul><p>Overall, AI has the potential to improve the
  efficiency, effectiveness, and accuracy of the pharmaceutical and medical
  device markets, leading to better patient outcomes and reduced healthcare
  costs.</p>

<p>AI deploys applications that mimic human-level intelligence, while machine learning (ML) is the subset of those applications. Grand View Research estimates that the market for artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare was worth USD 15.4 billion in 2022 and is projected to increase to USD 208.2 billion by 2030 at a projected CAGR of 37.5%. That's a remarkable growth rate, reflecting the predicted value delivery to the healthcare market's largely early-phase use of AI. Given the predicted growth in the health sector, many professionals may wonder why they have not yet looked into AI. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of those applications that are not explicitly programmed or learnt, whereas artificial intelligence (AI) uses applications that resemble human-level intelligence. Together, these quickly developing technologies are boosting productivity and efficiency in a variety of industrial manufacturing.</p>
