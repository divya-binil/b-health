  the death blow,’ says…'

Almost 22 years ago, Sumana Reddy, M.D., and two other doctors set up a family medicine practice in the rural area of Salinas, California. Now she worries the coronavirus could be the death of it.

Like many other physician practices across the country, Reddy is worried if her practice can survive the cash crunch caused by the pandemic.

The Acacia Family Medical Group is not what a well-heeled practice, with more than 50% of its patients bilingual, agricultural workers, Reddy says.
