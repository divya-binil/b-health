<p><a href="https://hitconsultant.net/category/emr-ehr/">Electronic medical records (EMRs) </a>are widely expected to serve as a cornerstone technology that drives the delivery of modern patient care.&nbsp;</p><p>But can the EMR alone support all the informatics capabilities required by an ever-evolving healthcare industry? The rapid growth of precision medicine, particularly the use of genetic and genomic information during clinical decision making, is a compelling example that functionality beyond the EMR is required. Not only does genomic data represent a category of information used differently than traditional clinical knowledge, but the volume of data generated through molecular testing alone also requires informatics and management of a higher magnitude than previously required.</p>
