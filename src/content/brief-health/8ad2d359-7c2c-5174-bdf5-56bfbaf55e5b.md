<p>Data privacy scandals, help in rigging elections, spreading fake news on COVID and vaccines: Facebook has been through a lot and users are not happy with the social media giant’s performance. However, Mark Zuckerberg’s company does not only have a political and social impact, but it’s also getting quite relevant in healthcare.</p><p>We looked around what Facebook currently does in healthcare and evaluated whether those are viable ways to follow in the future.</p><p>The social media machine built on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/19/how-tech-leaders-delivered-us-into-evil-john-naughton">“<i>sophisticated, computer-driven engines for extracting users’ personal information and data trails</i></a>“, found itself in the middle of social and political debates as it failed to take into consideration its influence on its users – be it individuals, companies, publishers or nations.</p><p>From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> through the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/facebook-ban-trump-timeline-e1ce70879eca7cfa3a28f66cb3c8d685">Trump campaigns</a> to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-vaccine-covid-misinformation-social-media-nytimes-report-2021-7">COVID-19 misinformation</a>, the giant failed to act upon serious issues in time. And as news arouse about the tech giant’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/facebook-unveils-its-first-foray-into-personal-digital-healthcare-tools/?guccounter=1">Preventive Health tool</a> and is said to be <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90606044/facebook-health-tracker-wearable">building its own wearable</a>, we can’t NOT connect the dots and realise how Facebook is slowly stepping into healthcare.</p><p>So we looked around what its relation is to healthcare. Does it handle private health data and if so, how exactly? Does it allow the dissemination of insane, health-related fake news? How does it fair in community building and how does it offer its own tools for health issues? Let’s see.</p>
