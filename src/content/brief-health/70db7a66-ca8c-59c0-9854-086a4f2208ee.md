<p>The Next Generation Accountable Care Organization model reduced gross Medicare spending in performance years 2016 to 2019 by $667 million (1.2%), according to <a href="https://innovation.cms.gov/data-and-reports/2021/nextgenaco-fg-fourthevalrpt">findings</a>&nbsp;released last week by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Net Medicare spending for PYs 2016-2019 rose by 0.4% after accounting for shared savings and other incentive payments.</p><p>Participants in the <a href="https://innovation.cms.gov/innovation-models/next-generation-aco-model">model</a>&nbsp;can choose varying levels of financial risk, and receive financial incentives and care management tools to improve health outcomes and lower spending for an assigned Medicare fee-for-service population. CMS last year extended the five-year model through 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional results from the first four performance years, see the full <a href="https://innovation.cms.gov/data-and-reports/2021/nextgenaco-fourthevalrpt">evaluation report</a>.<br>&nbsp;</p>
