<p><strong>In our latest e-book, </strong><i><strong>The Technological Future of Medical Specialties</strong></i><strong>, we reflect on the major impact digital health and related technologies will have on 20 medical practices. While technologies will play an important role in practically every medical specialty, they wonâ€™t all be as specifically intertwined with digital health technologies as those we focused on.</strong></p><p>We individually analyse how advanced technologies will influence those 20 medical specialties and explore how patient empowerment will shape the medical profession and the required skills needed for everyone working in this industry. To dive into the transformative force that digital health technologies will bring to the roles of physicians and their toolset in the 21st century, we invite you to purchase a copy of the e-book, <a href="https://leanpub.com/future-of-medical-specialties"><i>The Technological Future of Medical Specialties</i></a><i>,</i> on LeanPub.</p>
