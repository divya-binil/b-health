<p>The healthcare industry was starting to recognize the importance of high value data as they moved from fee-for-service reimbursement to value-based care models – but the COVID-19 pandemic made it even more apparent that hospitals need the ability to access and integrate data from multiple sources in order to make meaningful clinical and business decisions.
“That has increased the need for governance of all that data, from both inside and outside of the hospital, so providers feel like they can trust and then use that data to make decisions that impact care.”
“These capabilities can provide you the data to inform you where, when and how to shift – and how to do so in a way that puts your organization where it needs to be from a financial perspective so you are in a position to deliver the care your patients need,” said Elbert</p>
