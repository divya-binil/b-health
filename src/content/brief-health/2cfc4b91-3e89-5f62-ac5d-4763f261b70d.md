<p>By now, I’ve spent <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/what-i-learnt-about-a-i-by-playing-1000-hours-of-chess-in-a-year/">over one thousand hours</a> playing chess at a professional level. Not to become the next world champion, but to better understand the language of A.I. or the language of anticipation.</p><p>While on this journey, I also looked into the history of the board game and became convinced that it serves as the perfect metaphor for what is coming to healthcare. With their similar backgrounds and the integration of A.I. in the fields, their transformation will also bear similarities.&nbsp;</p><p>And by looking into the transformation that A.I. brought about to chess, we can derive insights into how this upcoming change will happen in medicine. This is what we will be looking at in this article.</p>
