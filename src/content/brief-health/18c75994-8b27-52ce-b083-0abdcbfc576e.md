<p>Health IT leaders and federal officials have spent years attempting to solve the challenges Larry Ellison says his company can fix. Many experts are skeptical. But if Oracle can make it happen, it would be a major achievement for healthcare. In a move that promises to shake up the healthcare industry, Oracle this month announced a bold vision after acquiring health IT giant Cerner for more than $28 billion.
The combined companies will soon create a national health records database that pulls data from thousands of hospitals, said Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison.
It also makes it challenging for research teams at public health agencies to conduct studies on big groups of people, since they're frequently restricted to the patient data available within their hospital network, he added.
The national healthcare records system that Oracle is planning would be a way to pool all this data together in an anonymous format, making it available to healthcare providers and researchers while still protecting patients' privacy.
As I have stated before, there will be a shift away from Cerner's usage of Amazon AWS for their population health platform towards OCI, or Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.</p>
