<p>People’s health behaviors, including diet, exercise, and wellness visits, continue to change.
If most of us have a basic understanding of what ‘healthy’ is, why is there so much variation to our individual approaches to personal health and ultimately our overall wellness?
Four distinct Health &amp; Wellness Personas are identified at the intersection of an individual’s actions (adherence vs avoidance) and their attitude (enthusiastic vs indifferent) as it relates to their health and wellness.
Measured attitudes by understanding, for example, how people value their health, their belief that dietary choices and exercise habits are important components to their overall health, and whether they feel supported by family or peers in their wellness goals.
Be sure to keep Wellness Strivers up to date on your latest tips, products, and services as they have an enthusiastic attitude toward health along with a high level of adherence that makes them more likely to be open to new things.</p>
