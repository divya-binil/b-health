<p>Movano Health aims to stand out from the wearables crowd with a women’s health focus and strategy that is centered on obtaining FDA clearances. The clever ring from Movano Health has a stylish polished-aluminum style that would look great in any woman's jewellery collection. Nevertheless, the ring is designed specifically for women and is meant to be worn constantly in order to monitor things like heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, menstruation symptoms, sleep patterns, and more. The Pleasanton, California-based business, which went public in March 2021, is working to submit heart rate and oxygen data from the ring to the FDA and is creating a radio frequency-enabled sensor for blood pressure and glucose monitoring. As they prepare to introduce the Evie, Movano's founder and chief technology officer Michael Leabman, an entrepreneur with an MIT education and more than 200 patents, and vice president of strategy Stacy Salvi spoke with MedTech Dive this week.</p>
