<p>The Choctaw Nation Health Services Authority (CNHSA), which operates eight clinics and a hospital with 45 beds in Southeast Oklahoma, has chosen Motient's web-based Mission Control platform to guarantee high-quality patient care throughout the patient transfer process, the company said today. The Motient platform facilitates interfacility communication, enables the collection of hitherto unavailable data, and aids hospitals and health systems in establishing uniform protocols for emergency patient mobility. CNHSA sends patients who need a higher level of care to acute care hospitals, trauma centres, and other specialist care institutions as a rural health system servicing communities in full or part of 13 counties. Clinicians usually spend hours on the phone confirming a patient's suitable destination, which makes the process time-consuming.</p>
