<p>HIMSS22's State of Healthcare report also reveals that 60% of healthcare organizations did not have a structure in place to support digital transformation.<br><br>The pandemic has accelerated a lot of innovation in the digital space, in large part because it forced patients and providers to engage virtually, both synchronously and asynchronously, according to panelists at HIMSS State of Healthcare 2022.
Yesterday, at the HIMSS State of Healthcare 2022, a panel of leaders representing payer, provider, and patient voices joined to discuss the current healthcare landscape and what the future might hold.
These leaders shared research that highlighted global data trends, shedding light on key opportunities and challenges in this journey to digitally transform and personalize medicine.
As Dr. Gibbings-Isaac stated, "Clinicians need to feel more supported and invested in the [process of] digital transformation" for it to be successful.
Digital transformation can provide us the means to meet providers and patients where they're at, and to bring them tools to optimize and personalize care at the time and place they need it, according to the speakers.</p>
