<p>For AI to have impact, it must take a human-centered approach, easily integrate into physician workflows and be friendly to use.<br><br>Artificial intelligence has the ability to make physicians' lives easier, according to experts and former clinicians.</p><p>For example, AI has the ability to make medicine keyboard-free, a futuristic goal which would be welcomed by physicians who spend most of their time with a patient in front of a computer. The technology would require a visual interface or dictation.&nbsp;</p><p>But AI is starting to move into a keyboard-free environment, said Dr. Ruben Amarasingham, a former practicing physician&nbsp;who is founder and CEO of Pieces Technologies, a healthcare artificial intelligence and technology company.&nbsp;</p>
