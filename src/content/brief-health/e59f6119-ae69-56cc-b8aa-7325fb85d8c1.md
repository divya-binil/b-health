<p>Globally and annually, trillions of dollars and data are wasted in the traditional healthcare industry.1</p><p>The total time we spend in a traditional medical setting getting checked for a potential disease accounts for only a tiny fraction of the total time we spend living in our life settings.&nbsp; And, according to a recent survey in the US, over half of primary care physicians spend less than 16 minutes with a patient per consultation.2 This leads to data that is far too often siloed, unstructured, and intermittently generated, hindering its ability to be used efficiently within our healthcare system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The vast majority of the time we spend living our lives is outside the traditional medical setting – in the <i>life setting</i> – a place that provides access to a significantly larger window to observe the signs of disease.&nbsp; However, thus far, there have been a lack of solutions to measure these signs.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the traditional medical setting continues to rely on costly and invasive approaches that are also inaccessible to everyday consumers without a physician’s involvement.&nbsp; This often creates a barrier to accessibility, affordability, and convenience, by requiring a physical intermediary (such as blood or tissue) to be measured to map or “mark” a disease (known as biomarkers).&nbsp;</p>
