<p>Numerous prestigious healthcare institutions, including Ascension and Intermountain Healthcare, have chosen Qualtrics solutions for the third quarter of 2022, according to a recent announcement from Qualtrics (Nasdaq: XM), the market pioneer and innovator in the experience management category. These healthcare institutions are pioneering and setting the standard for human-centered care by using technology to better understand patients, caregivers, and staff not just their experiences receiving or providing care, but also their emotions, goals, and preferences. According to Dr. Adrienne Boissy, chief medical officer of Qualtrics, "Empathy anchored in listening, comprehending, and acting has never been more vital in the healthcare profession." Without slowing down to listen via all available channels, we cannot start to address the complex problems of access to care, inequities, and meaningful connectivity with patients and caregivers.</p>
