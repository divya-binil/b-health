<p>According to the survey, which reached more than 930 Bicycle Health patients, three-quarters of respondents don’t believe the pandemic has complicated recovery.
“Over 10 million people misuse opioids each year, yet extreme stigma, lack of accessibility, and the cost of treatment prevent them from reaching recovery,” said Ankit Gupta, CEO and founder of Bicycle Health, in a statement.
More than half of respondents reported having a primary care physician and said they feel comfortable talking to them about addiction and treatment.
But Bicycle Health’s own referral rates to primary care physicians could be better, Gupta acknowledged.</p>
