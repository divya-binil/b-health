**HOUSTON (PRWEB) NOVEMBER 16, 2022**

Symplr®, the leader in enterprise healthcare operations software, has announced the findings of its 2022 Symplr Compass Survey. The research captured sentiments from decision makers at top U.S. health systems to obtain insights about healthcare operations technology at their organizations, including effectiveness, challenges, and areas of opportunity. The results are published in the 2022 symplr Compass Survey Report, “From Disparate to Dynamic: Opportunities and Challenges in U.S. Healthcare Operations.”

The data revealed that nearly 60% of respondents use more than 50 point solutions to manage healthcare operations. This includes 35% of respondents who use 51-150 point solutions and over 24% of health system CIOs who use between 151-500 solutions for functions including workforce management, provider data management, contracting and spend (supply chain), facility access, quality, safety, and compliance. 84% of health system CIOs believe there is an opportunity to streamline and automate healthcare operations solutions to combat financial pressure, burnout, and other challenges the healthcare industry faces.
