<p>Pharmacogenomics—the study of genetic influences on an individual’s response to therapeutic medications—is an area of personalized medicine that is gaining momentum. Although pharmacogenomics has been around for a while, providers, health plans, pharmacists and legislators are developing a greater appreciation for its potential benefits and applications.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How Can Pharmacogenomics Improve Outcomes?</strong></p><p>By considering a person’s DNA in treatment options, providers can determine how an individual’s genetic profile may impact the way the individual could respond to specific therapies. For example, certain gene changes may indicate a person is a high metabolizer and thus may require a higher starting dose of medication to have a therapeutic effect. Alternatively, other gene changes may indicate a low metabolizer status, which may indicate the need for a lower starting dosage to achieve the same therapeutic benefit while minimizing side effects.&nbsp;</p><p>There are many advantages to using genomics to inform therapeutic decisions.&nbsp;</p>
