<p>Google is reportedly making inroads toward creating a patient health record tool. &nbsp;</p><p>According to STAT's Erin Brodwin, the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/04/09/google-health-records-app-care-studio/">company is recruiting patients</a> to weigh in on how they want to access their own medical record data â€“ potentially to help shape user-facing software.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>"Google is running a user feedback program to test features that give users the ability to collect health information from their provider patient portals, organize, search&nbsp;and share it with the people they trust in a private and secure manner," said a Google spokesperson in response to a request for comment from <i>Healthcare IT News</i>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>The moves follow the implementation of federal information blocking rules, which officially went <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/confusion-remains-about-onc-information-blocking-rules-even-after-start-date">into effect on April 5</a> and which should allow patients readier access to their medical records.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>As Brodwin notes, this could potentially open the floor to&nbsp;more tools enabling users to control their health data.</p><p>At this point, Google is reportedly recruiting about 300 Android users from Epic-using health systems in Atlanta, Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area for its study.&nbsp;The company is using available APIs to help participants connect to information in provider portals.</p>
