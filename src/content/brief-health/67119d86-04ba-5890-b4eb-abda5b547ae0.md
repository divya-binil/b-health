<p>Toku Eyes has already established local partnerships with EyeCheq, which is building a nationwide network of self-service retinal image kiosks, and Unified Imaging, a provider of image management platforms for eye care clinics. The company has come up with the ORAiCLE platform which is said to be more cost-effective and easily accessible in locations such as pharmacies and self-service retinal photo kiosks. Toku Eyes also claims its technology can work accurately with low-quality images compared to Google's similar technology. "It is often unknown that the cardiovascular system is able to be photographed through the eye," it said. Toku Eyes' AI platform has been used as part of diabetic screening services in public and private health facilities in New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>
