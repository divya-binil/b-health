<p>Focusing on increasing access to reproductive and sexual health for underserved communities, the company’s goal is to provide longitudinal care from contraception, perinatal to menopause through telemedicine, medication delivery and ongoing care.
Twentyeight Health has a proprietary network of Medicaid-registered physicians who serve patient needs in primary care deserts, including rural areas, said Amy Fan, the company’s co-founder and president.
The company’s intelligent workforce platform and forecasting algorithms help organizations optimize workforce planning, staffing and scheduling while providing on-demand access to resource pools across health systems, said Kevin Godsey, CEO.
Addressing arguably health care’s greatest challenge optimizing the clinical workforce this resource offers a data-driven approach to help leaders build core staff schedules and plug in flexible resources when and where they’re needed.
</p><p>The company offers a career acceleration and talent-sourcing platform for underrepresented leaders in health care and life sciences.
The Humanity Talent Network is a private membership community for senior health care leaders who are women and/or people of color and provides resources to help leaders prepare for their next career moves, navigate new career opportunities and flourish not only in current roles but also in recent career transitions.
This platform addresses many critical factors required to increase C-suite diversity while providing needed resources to help build the pipeline of aspiring future health care leaders.
Addressing the ubiquitous problem of how to increase access to behavioral health services, the company helps health systems provide the care their communities need.
Currently, the company helps hospitals and health systems in providing ambulatory and acute care services, including consulting for emergency departments.
With the company’s build-out vision, this telehealth platform can help hospitals and health systems provide greater access to behavioral health services.</p>
