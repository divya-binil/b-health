<p>In addition to the Covid-19 pandemic, recession discussion is currently in the news, and there are conflicting views on the future of the economy and how things will turn out. There is a lot for B2B marketers to be financially cautious of as they work to expand their company and create new sales prospects, especially when you take into account high mortgage rates and rumours of real estate bubbles.
