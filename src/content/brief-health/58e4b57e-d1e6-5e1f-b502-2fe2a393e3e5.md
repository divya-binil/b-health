<p>Artificial intelligence (A.I.) is on course to usher <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/artificial-intelligence-and-the-art-of-medicine/">the real era of The Art of Medicine</a>. By automating administrative tasks and aiding in decision-making, these smart algorithms promise to free up physicians’ valuable time; time that can be dedicated where the human touch is essential in healthcare.&nbsp;</p><p>The technology is also attracting investors to fuel growth in the field. In 2019, the global market size for A.I. in healthcare was <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-market#:~:text=The%20global%20artificial%20intelligence%20in%20healthcare%20market%20size%20was%20estimated,USD%205.9%20billion%20in%202020.">valued at $3.9 billion</a>. As for 2025, that market size is forecasted to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/826993/health-ai-market-value-worldwide/">skyrocket to $28 billion</a>. However, this increased interest is also leading to misleading information and hype around the technology. Companies falsely label their solutions as A.I.-based or inflate their tools’ performance to attract investors and clients. News headlines overuse the term to increase their audience engagement for the sake of sensationalism. It has thus become a tricky issue among physicians to separate the hype from the facts around A.I. in healthcare.</p><p><br><a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/a-physicians-visual-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/">Read on medicalfuturist.com</a></p>
