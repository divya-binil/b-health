<p>More and more clinics and hospitals are using artificial intelligence. This article explains what are the 5 levels automation and where can we use each. As you launch your telemedicine app, the virtual assistant asks, "How may I serve you today? You've chosen to see a doctor after having a sore throat and runny nose for a few days. The assistant asks you about your symptoms and then scans its database to come up with a cause. The chatbot responds, "There's an 83% chance that you're having allergic symptoms." "I will send your prescription to you shortly. If you are not satisfied or continue to feel unwell, though, kindly ask for a human doctor." You choose to heed the artificial intelligence's counsel and take the recommended medications after weighing the likelihood of the diagnosis and its capacity for deduction. However, the symptoms continue after two weeks, so you choose to turn to medication.&nbsp;</p><p>In medicine, automation refers to the use of technology to perform tasks traditionally done by humans. There are several levels of automation in medicine, ranging from simple tasks such as scheduling appointments to more complex tasks such as diagnosing diseases. The various levels of automation in medicine are:</p><ul><li>Administrative automation: This level of automation involves the use of technology to manage administrative tasks such as scheduling appointments, managing patient records, and billing.</li><li>Diagnostic automation: This level of automation involves the use of technology to assist with diagnosing diseases. For example, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems can help radiologists detect abnormalities on medical images.</li><li>Therapeutic automation: This level of automation involves the use of technology to deliver therapies to patients. For example, insulin pumps can automatically deliver insulin to patients with diabetes.</li><li>Procedural automation: This level of automation involves the use of technology to perform procedures traditionally done by humans. For example, surgical robots can perform minimally invasive surgeries with greater precision and accuracy than human surgeons.</li><li>Cognitive automation: This level of automation involves the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to analyze patient data and assist with decision-making. For example, predictive analytics can help doctors identify patients who are at risk of developing certain conditions, allowing for early intervention and treatment.</li></ul>
