<p>The AI deployment will focus on triaging cerebral haemorrhage cases and enhancing the monitoring of brain disorder patients. This collaboration deal follows the recent signing of a similar multi-year partnership between SNAC and medical imaging provider Synergy Radiology to also develop new AI solutions for clinical radiology.
"This landmark collaboration agreement with St Vincent’s, a major Australian teaching hospital, will deliver novel healthcare solutions at scale and bolster SNAC’s growing suite of imaging-AI and informatics products," SNAC COO Tim Wang also commented.</p>
