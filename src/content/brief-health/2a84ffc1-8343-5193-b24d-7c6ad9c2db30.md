<p>BERKELEY, Calif. (Dec. 8, 2021) -- Robin, a healthcare technology company, today announced Series B funding of $50 million. With the new investment, Robin will expand its service into new markets, as well as invest in its engineering, product, and sales teams to further deliver value for physicians nationwide. Scale Venture Partners led the round with participation from Khosla Ventures and continued support from Norwest Venture Partners, Social Leverage, Meridian Street Capital, and IA Ventures.</p><p>The U.S. healthcare system is ripe for change as complex administrative rules increasingly burden doctors and frustrate patients. Robin removes these barriers so that doctors and patients can get the most of their time together.</p><p>The Robin Assistant™ sits in the exam room and ambiently generates the documentation required to meet complex rules needed for insurers, compliance, and liability. This allows doctors to focus on patients, save time, and reduce the risk of practicing in today's complex healthcare market for little to no net cost. Robin combines cutting edge technology with trained healthcare staff to deliver a seamless experience that integrates directly into the electronic medical record. Data is secured by using military-grade, 256-bit encryption and the system is completely HIPAA-compliant. Robin complies with rigorous auditing procedures to ensure robust data protection and related best practices including the SOC 2 certification program.</p><blockquote><p>"We go to the doctor looking for comfort and expertise. Unfortunately, doctors today have to spend so much of their time checking boxes to meet administrative requirements," said Emilio Galán, CEO at Robin. "We believe that nothing, whether it be insurance rules or technology, should get in the way of care and this funding allows us to scale that experience for doctors and their patients."</p></blockquote><p>“Documenting is a critical part of medicine, but it shouldn’t be the driving factor in patient care,” said Dr. Mark J.R. Moulton, a physician at OAM. “By partnering with Robin, I’m able to practice medicine and provide my patients with the focus and attention they deserve without having to worry about dictating, charting, or coding.”</p><p>With the Series B investment, Robin will continue to empower physician autonomy in delivering expert care for their patients without administrative barriers.</p><p>Doctors save an average of 90 minutes per day previously spent on manual data capture. Additionally, Robin guarantees its work in the event of an audit so that physicians are truly free to focus on what's most important: caring for patients.</p><p>“Robin is a category-breaking company disrupting the broken system that demands physicians prove they’re delivering quality healthcare,” said Rory O’Driscoll, partner at Scale Venture Partners. “Robin’s 300% compounded annual growth demonstrates a proven track record of success in freeing physicians from administrative minutiae and preparing them for the future demands of healthcare.”</p><p>“We partnered with Scale and Khosla because of exceptional track records in supporting high-growth companies with massive impact,” said Galan. “This investment could not be more timely as Robin grows the team behind our mission to remove barriers to health with more personal, uninterrupted care for patients.”</p><p>With the new funding, Robin will bring the Robin Assistant™ to new markets and expand support for existing users.</p><p><strong>About Scale Venture Partners</strong><br>Scale is a Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm that invests in the future leaders of enterprise software.
