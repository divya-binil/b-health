<p>Focus is on improved patient outcomes, smoother administrative functions. Throughout the past three years, there have been significant changes in the healthcare sector. Health care practitioners are acutely aware of how technology can impact-and improve-the administrative side of a medical practise as well as patient outcomes after rushing to fulfil patient requirements during the pandemic. Many private clinics will be compelled to implement cutting-edge patient engagement technologies in 2020, including telehealth platforms and accepting payment methods through digital wallets. The same healthcare organisations are currently improving their technical capabilities, which has a favourable effect on productivity, provides more accurate patient data, and generates demonstrable income increases. But other factors are also advancing society. We anticipate a rise of independent practises in the upcoming year. There are several ways medical practices can embrace patient-centric technologies to improve the patient experience and outcomes. Here are some ideas:</p><ul><li>Electronic health records (EHRs): Implementing EHRs can help medical practices manage patient data efficiently and provide better patient care. Patients can also access their medical records through a patient portal, allowing them to view their lab results, appointment schedules, and prescription information.</li><li>Telemedicine: Telemedicine enables patients to receive medical care remotely, which can be particularly beneficial for those who live in rural areas or have mobility issues. Medical practices can use video conferencing and remote monitoring technologies to conduct consultations, follow-ups, and check-ins.</li><li>Mobile apps: Medical practices can develop mobile apps that allow patients to access health information, schedule appointments, and communicate with their healthcare providers. These apps can also provide reminders for medication and appointment schedules.</li><li>Wearables and remote monitoring devices: Medical practices can leverage wearables and remote monitoring devices to track patient health metrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose levels. This data can be used to identify potential health issues and provide personalized care recommendations.</li><li>Health information exchange (HIE): Medical practices can participate in HIE networks, which allow them to securely share patient information with other healthcare providers. This can improve care coordination and patient outcomes by ensuring that all providers have access to up-to-date medical information.</li><li>Patient feedback mechanisms: Medical practices can implement patient feedback mechanisms such as surveys and online reviews to gather feedback from patients and identify areas for improvement. This can help medical practices understand their patients' needs and preferences, which can inform the development of patient-centric technologies and services.</li></ul><p>Overall, the key to embracing patient-centric technologies is to prioritize the patient experience and use technology to improve patient outcomes, increase efficiency, and provide personalized care.</p>
