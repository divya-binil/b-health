<p>Along with its partner organizations, HIMSS submitted a letter noting that although the SEC’s proposed rules focus on increasing investors’ knowledge of companies’ cybersecurity postures, it departs significantly from the Commission’s 2018 interpretive guidance, which effectively balances investor interests with companies’ cybersecurity disclosure obligations. HIMSS and the other signing organizations, are willing to work with the SEC to revise the proposed rules so that investors can be provided with timely information about potential cyberattacks while mitigating the risks associated with disclosing sensitive cybersecurity information.</p>
