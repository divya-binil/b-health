<p>Outcome-based contracting is helping enable the shift from fee-for-service payment and delivery models to more value-based healthcare models<br><br>Outcome-based contracting is helping to drive value-based healthcare (VBHC) by transforming the way cutting edge and high-cost therapies are being delivered to patients and paid for.&nbsp;</p><p>In this interview, we sat down with Girisha Fernando, CEO of Lyfegen, whose company exists to improve the life of every patient by driving the world’s transition to value and outcome-based healthcare. Girisha shares his insights about the move towards VBHC, why this is so vital, and how corporations and startups can work together to be the necessary change.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Improving equality, affordability and access to healthcare&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>HT:</strong> <i>What problem in healthcare did you set out to solve when you created Lyfegen, and why was it important to you to solve that problem?</i></p><p><strong>Girisha Fernando</strong>: When I was a teenager, in just a short period of time, both of my grandfathers had passed away at a young age due to cancer and heart failure. If they would have had access to the right treatments, they might still&nbsp;be alive today.</p><p>We all have seen loved ones falling ill to a serious disease, and we want to make sure that they have the best possible treatment. This is why we created Lyfegen. We want&nbsp; to make healthcare more equitable by increasing access and affordability to healthcare and treatments for patients.&nbsp;</p>
