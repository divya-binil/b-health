<p>Cognitive screening methods supported by technology are growing in popularity as healthcare professionals realize the value of having faster, more affordable access to cognitive data that informs actionable next steps, says David Bates, CEO and cofounder of Linus Health, a brain health technology company.
A. Healthcare providers have long relied on paper and pencil-based tests to detect early signs of cognitive impairment, dementia and Alzheimer's disease in their patients and serve as the basis of referrals to specialists.
Similar to so many other parts of healthcare, though, digital innovation and device accessibility have opened up a wealth of opportunities to improve how providers detect and address brain health issues in primary care.
As the global population ages and we contend with daunting projections about a commensurate rise in cognitive and brain disorders, but not a commensurate increase in the number of specialists to help render care, digital technology offers new promise for earlier detection and timely intervention in the primary care setting.
More advanced digital solutions go even further, not only providing insights based on final test outputs, but also utilizing AI to assess a patient's whole process of taking a test for greater test sensitivity.</p><p>This is particularly relevant because, in practice, assessment of the process – as much as or even more than the result – is what specialists like neurologists and neuropsychologists use to formulate a clinical impression about a patient's health.
From there, providers – particularly primary care providers who first diagnose the majority of dementia cases – need actionable information to help them navigate what to do next for their patients, especially as the world continues to await breakthrough drugs.
While there may not be a surefire "treatment" yet, early detection affords patients the possibility of joining clinical trials and pursuing the best other options available today, which are evidence-based lifestyle and health adjustments.
In brain health, AI is unlocking a whole world of possibility for earlier detection – and intervention – at a time when the urgency has never been greater to find different approaches that can change the global outlook on brain health and aging.
However, the goal is to make it both possible and practical for providers to find cognitive issues earlier, understand better the specifics and implications of the issue, and help their patients take action as soon as possible – not to replace providers at any stage.
In this case, AI empowers providers with new visibility into their patients' brain health so they can, in turn, empower their patients with education and next steps as appropriate.
While this work is ongoing, we need to empower providers and patients with novel brain health insights and evidence-based health and lifestyle interventions that have the potential to meaningfully improve patients' and their families' lives.</p>
