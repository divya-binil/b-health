<p>Physicians often fail to note all secondary diagnoses, chronic conditions and comorbidities while treating patients, simply because the time required to comprehensively document at the point of care is overwhelming.
A workflow-integrated, AI-driven computer-assisted physician documentation (CAPD) system enables physicians to focus on patient care by providing unobtrusive guidance as to what information needs to be included to ensure clinical documentation integrity.
“With this AI technology, it’s possible to address the documentation edicts emanating from governmental bodies and insurance companies,” Budman said.
“Physicians simply receive AI-generated advice that enables them to produce clinical notes at the point of care very quickly, avoiding the stress involved with having to do so downstream.”
“Having clinically relevant expert advice right there at their fingertips and being able to add it to the note in less than 30 seconds can help physicians produce the documentation needed to receive proper reimbursement, while also improving workflow and alleviating stress,” he said.</p>
