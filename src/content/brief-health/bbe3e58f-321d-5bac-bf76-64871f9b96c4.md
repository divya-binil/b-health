<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has released guidance allowing federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and rural health clinics (RHCs) to provide distant site telehealth services.</p><p>For distant site services provided between July 1, 2020, and the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency, FQHCs and RHCs should use HCPCS code G2025 to identify the services furnished via telehealth. Claims with G2025 will be paid the $92 payment rate.</p><p>Costs for distant site telehealth services will not be used to determine the FQHC PPS rate or RHC AIR. However, they must be reported on the appropriate cost form.</p><p><br><a href="https://www.aafp.org/journals/fpm/blogs/gettingpaid/entry/FQHC_covid_telehealth.html">Read on aafp.org</a></p>
