<p>Microsoft wants to leverage its work with AI and Chat-GPT to take this tool to the next level. In a press release earlier this week, Nuance expressed its commitment to increasing AI driven innovation, announcing “Dragon Ambient eXperience (DAX) Express, a workflow-integrated, fully automated clinical documentation application that is the first to combine proven conversational and ambient AI with OpenAI's newest and most capable model, GPT-4…[as a means to] reduce administrative burden and empower clinicians to spend more time taking care of patients and less time on paperwork.”</p>
