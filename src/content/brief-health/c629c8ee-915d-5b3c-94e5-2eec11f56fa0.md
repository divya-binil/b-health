Specialty pharmacy team members have an opportunity to extend their patient care role by providing support to patients who are battling chronic diseases. Specialty pharmacy team members such as pharmacists and nurses can extend their patient care role by providing additional support to patients with chronic diseases and advocating for better patient outcomes. In the second part of a two-part series of Healthcare Strategies, Shaunte Law Rhames, RN, BSN, an infusion care nurse supervisor working in inpatient management services, and Nichol Marrero Nieves, PharmD CSP, a patient management service pharmacist who specializes in neurology, behavioral health, and chronic inflammatory diseases at AllianceRx Walgreens Pharmacy, one of the nation&#39;s largest home delivery and specialty pharmacies for patients with rare and chronic diseases, discusses ways pharmaceutical staff members can extend their patient care role to support and care for patients who struggle to manage their chronic diseases.
