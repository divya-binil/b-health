<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>             <p><em>ContinuumCloud’s patient engagement app, CaredFor, now includes Care Journeys to provide guidance and support to patients beyond traditional treatment settings.</em></p>  <p><strong>(Tampa, Fla. August 29, 2022)&nbsp;</strong>ContinuumCloud, the leading provider of cloud-based solutions for behavioral health organizations, announced the release of the new Care Journeys feature in their CaredFor app.</p>  <p>The Care Journeys feature allows providers to build configurable experiences that can be delivered to individuals or groups step-by-step at a predetermined cadence. These steps can include journaling, reading an article, completing a survey, and other engaging activities that help patients and alumni stay motivated on their journey to wellbeing.</p>  <p>Providers can easily build a Care Journey within the app that focuses on a particular condition, a specific theme, or any other scenario that aligns with treatment goals to extend the continuum of care beyond traditional appointments. This feature of the CaredFor app provides a digital approach to augment in-person or virtual appointments and engage patients in between sessions to improve outcomes.</p>  <p>“We’ve designed Care Journeys to enhance service delivery and maximize the impact of traditional treatment,” said Ben Wilkins, Director of Product at ContinuumCloud. “In a few simple steps, providers can evolve their care plans into a digital format delivered to patients in the palm of their hand. This enables organizations to provide more resources to those in need, while efficiently scaling their operations.”</p>  <p><a href="https://resources.continuumcloud.com/patient-engagement/care-journeys-datasheet">Care Journeys</a> is exclusively available in the CaredFor app, ContinuumCloud’s <a href="https://continuumcloud.com/patient-engagement-platform/">patient engagement platform</a> for behavioral health and human services organizations.
