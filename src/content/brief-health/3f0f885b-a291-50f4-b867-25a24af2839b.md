<p>University of California, Berkeley, medical scientists use a Bluetooth-enabled tracking watch to study ways the bond between patient and caregiver benefits the patient.</p><p>Couples with higher relationship satisfactions showed greater linkage in their physiological responses (for example, heart rate and skin conductance) during face-to-face interactions, which suggests a greater “biological connection” between the couples.</p><p>This is according to a variety of studies, including a recently published paper in the <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i> by Dr. Robert Levenson and Dr. Kuan-Hua Chen at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>In addition, there has been emerging evidence further suggesting that “being physically linked” with a partner’s physiological response may even have important implications to individuals’ mental and physical health.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
