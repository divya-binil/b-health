<p>The pandemic has forced many healthcare stakeholders to seek out innovative tech solutions that improve their revenue cycle management, as the crisis continues to highlight the inefficiencies of an overly complicated (and often manual) process. After months of reducing activity and suspending elective procedures, healthcare facilities must reassess their business strategy with a focus towards improving operations.</p><p>While COVID-19 exposed many areas of inefficiencies over the past several months, many of these challenges have plagued practices long before the pandemic began. This is due to inadequate, siloed solutions that werenâ€™t focused on minimizing patient liability during each step of the revenue cycle process. By focusing on front-end activities to reduce patient liability, practices can improve time to cash and reduce work required on the back-end.</p>
