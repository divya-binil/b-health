<p>Technology often stands between providers and effective patient care. It’s time we help providers get back to doing the job they love with better data and more seamless workflows.<br><br>Over the last decade, technology has allowed for advancements in the way we diagnose complex diseases, transmit large datasets, and manage patient health records. But technology has also become so much of a burden that doctors are leaving the profession because of it.<br><br>It is time we help providers get back to doing the job they love.<br><br>Providers are trained to diagnose and treat patients, not stare at a monitor to decipher insurance codes or calculate patient costs. Unfortunately, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital/new-research-links-hard-use-ehrs-and-physician-burnout"><strong>AMA found</strong></a> that providers are spending upwards of two hours in the EHR for every one hour of patient care.<br><br>When looking at prescribing processes specifically, a<a href="https://go.pardot.com/l/814043/2020-09-23/6g23g"><strong> recent RxRevu survey</strong></a> found that 77% of providers must change, manage, or resend a prescription order once it has already been sent to the pharmacy. Additionally,&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/25/9/1197/5047907"><strong>a study</strong></a> featured in JAMIA found that prescribers had to click anywhere from 14 to 62 times to complete a simple medication order. In order to reduce this type of unnecessary burden, providers need better, more trustworthy data, delivered when it matters most.</p>
