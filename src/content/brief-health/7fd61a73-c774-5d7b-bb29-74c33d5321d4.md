  3 Barriers'

Managing patients with multiple chronic conditions-who, according to the RAND Corp., account for about a quarter of the U.S. population but more than two-thirds of healthcare costs-is critical to success in value-based models.

The only problem? The health system was purpose-built for episodic care rather than the ongoing, community-based care this population typically needs.

To learn more about the challenges of managing chronic care, Sage Growth Partners conducted a survey of over 100 healthcare leaders in early 2019. Respondents were roughly equally divided between health system executives and leaders of physician practices.

What we found is a large gap between need and ability. While virtually all (98%) respondents believe chronic care management is very important, only about half (53%) say they’re doing it very well.
