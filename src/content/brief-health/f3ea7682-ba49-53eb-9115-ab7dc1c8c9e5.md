<p>Here are some ways decentralized clinical trials have the potential to improve participation rates across difficult-to-enroll populations.<br><br>We have a moral and scientific obligation to expand access so that clinical research can benefit all people in a much more equitable way. Never has this been more apparent than during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has dramatically and disproportionately affected minorities and POC. Despite calls to ensure diverse patient populations are enrolled in <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/coronavirus-covid-19/">COVID-19</a> treatment and vaccine trials, minority participation in these studies has not been robust, and targeted outreach efforts to recruit diverse patient populations have been slow to launch.</p>
