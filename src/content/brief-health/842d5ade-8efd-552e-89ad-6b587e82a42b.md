<p>Fake drugs take the lives of hundreds of thousands of people annualy. A new idea can give a powerfull and very accessible tool to patients to avoid risks<br><br>According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), fake malaria drugs alone could be responsible for 270,000 deaths in Africa every single year.
The dangers of fake or substandard drugs are obvious: sick people lose time while waiting to recover after taking the fake pills.
In some cases, fake drugs ‘only’ do nothing.
And the lack of genuine malaria remedies is only the tip of the fake drugs iceberg.
Why are people taking fake drugs?
Fake drugs are getting a problem in the Western World as well
According to this report, in the U.S. alone, 19 million consumers are buying medications outside of the safe drug supply.
People have to know that fake drugs exist, and how easily they can slip into the supply chain even in the most developed countries.
The third pillar is to include various safety measures in the supply chain of drugs.</p>
