<p>The new body temperature sensor which has arrived on the Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra, can help women better understand their health.
Apple’s new body temperature sensor will integrate new fertility features, which include body temperature-based ovulation tracking.
With the Apple Watch Series 8, the Health app will provide retrospective ovulation estimates using body temperature readings.
Every five seconds during sleep, the Series 8 will measure wrist temperature, looking for deviations from your baseline.It can then retrospectively alert to fertility windows, validate future window predictions, and alert women to menstrual cycle deviations, which can highlight serious issues like PCOS.
Shifting body temperatures can also indicate other health issues, which means the new sensor could have broader health uses too.</p>
