<p>Xosomix, a pre-clinical drug discovery company focused on harnessing diagnostic and therapeutic use of exosomes, the critical communication and transport mediators of the body, announced today the awarding of phase I SBIR grant from Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). This grant will enable Xosomix to develop an early diagnostic biomarker for endometriosis.
Xosomix, in collaboration with Dr. Sanjay Agarwal, MD, Director of Fertility Services and Center for Endometriosis Research &amp; Treatment at UC San Diego Health, seek to overcome hurdles in traditional approaches by focusing on cellular messengers called extracellular vesicles or ‘exosomes’ from menstrual effluent for the discovery of the non-invasive biomarker of endometriosis.</p>
