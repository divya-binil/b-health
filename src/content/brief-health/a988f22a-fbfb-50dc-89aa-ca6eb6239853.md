<p>The emergence of a new sort of medical information was a result of the widespread adoption of wearable digital technology in healthcare that produced big data. Similar to "generic" biomarkers, they give actionable insights regarding the biological state of individuals but are gathered via digital tools.

They are now producing an incredible amount of data about patients and those who aren't receiving medical care. Digital biomarkers are exactly that.</p>
