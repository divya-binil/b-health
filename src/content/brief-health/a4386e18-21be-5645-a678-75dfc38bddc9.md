Whole Life Health Care uses the vendorâ€™s Success Community platform to get best practices on technology and pandemic care to meet the excessive demands of the COVID-19 era. The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted the daily lives and workflows of healthcare providers across the globe.

THE PROBLEM

Whole Life Health Care in Newington, New Hampshire, is a family practice providing conventional medicine and complementary therapies. It needed advice on best practices to adjust to life during COVID-19 and continue treating patients safely and effectively. The team needed to create rapid-fire solutions to address the changes that happened seemingly overnight.

One of the challenges Whole Life faced during the onset of the pandemic was access to a reputable and efficient telehealth system to continue care for patients. Another challenge was how to leverage its digital billing platform to respond to the rapidly changing landscape of regulations and requirements around reimbursement.
