<p>The show floor will offer an opportunity to hear provider stories, experience the cloud-based company's new patient-facing app, meet new marketplace partners and see a renewed focus on "consumer-grade patient experience," says CEO Bob Segert. The CEO of athenahealth, Bob Segert, gave a sneak preview of the company's plans for the HIMSS23 Conference and Exhibition in April, saying that a key highlight will be the company's focus on enhancing the patient experience and creating a consumer-grade patient experience, including a showcase of new features. People frequently overlook the importance of the practice's back office experience, which is crucial, according to Segert, who spoke with Healthcare IT News. Yet the patient is also very important in this equation, he added. And how do patients perceive the athena-powered practises? Long forms that patients frequently fill out when entering a doctor's office will be replaced by new self-check-in features.</p>
