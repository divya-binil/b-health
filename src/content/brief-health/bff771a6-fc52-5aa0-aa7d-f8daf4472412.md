<p>The COVID-19 crisis has led some providers to inquire about partnering or acquiring insurance assets as the pandemic exposed the risk of relying on fee-for-service models.<br><br>A year since COVID-19 hit U.S. shores,&nbsp;the pandemic is still raging as deaths and cases strain hospital resources.&nbsp;</p><p>Amid the scrambling, however, providers and payers are adjusting to a new normal likely to continue for months if not beyond.&nbsp;Though arrival of vaccines has prompted hope,&nbsp;the rollout has been slow and fragmented, left up to each state to decide how to disseminate the shots.&nbsp;</p><p>And the deadly pandemic has spurred historic job losses and economic upheaval, which will have lingering effects on the health sector for some time.</p><p>These factors have accelerated moves to value-based care and led some providers to inquire about partnering or acquiring insurance assets as the pandemic exposed the risk of relying on fee-for-service models. At the same time, consumers are likely to seek continued access to telehealth, made widely available as an alternative to in-person care.</p>
