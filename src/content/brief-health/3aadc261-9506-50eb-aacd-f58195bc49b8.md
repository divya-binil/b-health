<p>With the advent of new medicines, the aim to move care away from inpatient and clinic settings and towards the home, and the widespread adoption of electronic health records, the discipline of oncology has undergone a major transformation in the delivery of cancer care during the past 25 years.</p><p>The creation of oral anti-cancer medications, such as cytotoxic chemotherapies that patients can self-administer at home, is one example of innovation. The NCCN Task Force Report: Oral Chemotherapy estimates that about 25% of new anti-cancer drugs under development are meant to be taken orally.</p><p>According to Dr. Parul Agarwal, an assistant professor of clinical medicine, the usage of these medications enables patients to become more independent in their care and allows them to spend more time at home.</p>
