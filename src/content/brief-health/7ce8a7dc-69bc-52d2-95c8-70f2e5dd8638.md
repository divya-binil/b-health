<p>The population health management (PHM) journey for provider organizations is not paved in gold, nor silver – it’s actually not paved at all – more of a dirt path with a steep climb. It is far from smooth and the ability to show demonstrable return on investment remains elusive. This is but one of the many findings from a nearly yearlong study Chilmark Research performed in 2019 in cooperation with a major EHR vendor.</p><p>Over the course of 2019, we conducted an in-depth web survey followed by a series of focus groups with organizations at virtually all levels of adoption PHM technology and strategy in support of their value-based care (VBC) programs. This research concluded in a <a href="https://go.chilmarkresearch.com/path-to-value-for-population-health-report">final report</a> that we released earlier this year.</p>
