<p>One tip from Epic physician and active practitioner Jackie Gerhart is to use the Hey Epic! voice assistant to cut the time physicians spend in Chart Review, In Basket, Orders, and Notes.</p><p>Commands like “Hey Epic! Order Albuterol, two milligrams,” and “Hey Epic! Search the chart for lipids,” let the system take on administrative work so that physicians can concentrate on their patients. One organization saved physicians an hour and a half per day. <a href="https://www.epicshare.org/tips-and-tricks/q-how-can-we-give-our-physicians-more-focused-time-with-their-patientsn-_a-activate-hey-epic-the-built-in-voice-assistant-_#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
