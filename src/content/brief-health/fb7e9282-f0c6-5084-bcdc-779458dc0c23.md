<p>This phrase got me thinking of medical practice owners and marketers who are so focused on taking care of their patients that they fail to notice the whole forest of revenue generation opportunities. The stress of running a practice and ensuring quality care can make providers lose sight of different ways to increase practice revenue.</p><p>For most medical practices, there are often opportunities to boost revenue by leveraging the existing services in new ways. The challenge, however, is taking the time to step back and recognize them.</p><p>And this is where the mastermind, or a healthcare marketing agency like <a href="https://www.practicebuilders.com/contact-us/"><strong>Practice Builders</strong></a>, can help you see the opportunities you are missing.</p>
