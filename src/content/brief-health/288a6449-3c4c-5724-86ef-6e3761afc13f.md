<p>When I was a fresh graduate ten years ago, I looked for an academic position that would protect my time for research. I was shocked to learn that I was "unqualified" because I had so few published publications and no research money. No organisation was willing to hire me for research with these deficiencies. I eventually received a job offer for a clinical position that would protect my time at 20%. With this amount of time, I was able to create a research programme without the need for funding, improve my research abilities without formal training, and quickly produce publications and awards without assistance. I was eventually able to reduce my clinical time and get the support I needed.&nbsp;</p>
