<p>Dr. Rocío Acuña Hidalgo, co-founder and CTO at pioneering health tech company Nostos Genomics, on the role of AI in genetic testing. Since the initial draught of a human genome, which was published as part of the Human Genome Project, sequencing and analysis of human DNA has come a long way. The market for genetic testing is expanding quickly due to the decreasing cost of DNA sequencing; from 2022 to 2030, the market for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) services is expected to rise by 18.3% annually. In this essay, Dr. Ansgar Lange of Nostos Genomics examines the potential applications of AI in the rapidly expanding field of genetic testing. Genetic mutations or variations in the human genome are the root cause of genetic illnesses, and geneticists must identify the causative variation.</p>
