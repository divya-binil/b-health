<p>According to a recent survey of leading digital health investors conducted by GSR Ventures, investors in the healthcare technology sector believe that a quantifiable return on investment (ROI) and clinical validation of the technology's platform will be the most important indicators of company success in 2023. More than 94% of investor respondents rated ROI as "essential" or "extremely important," and 79% said the same about clinical data and trials. According to Dr. Sunny Kumar, a Partner with GSR Ventures, "Generating a high ROI has always been crucial for health IT businesses and we're seeing that even more stressed in the present environment as purchasers prioritise their spending on products with the strongest value proposition." However, we were most thrilled to see the majority.</p>
