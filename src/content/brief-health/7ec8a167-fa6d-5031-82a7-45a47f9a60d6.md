<p>Burgdorf – Ypsomed (SIX: YPSN) and Sidekick Health today announced a collaboration to extend Ypsomed’s device and SmartServices offering by implementing a self-injection module in Sidekick’s proven digital therapeutics solution.
The combination of Ypsomed’s devices with Sidekick’s digital health behavioural economics and gamification expertise will form a unique solution delivering an engaging and personalized patient experience to people with chronic conditions, as well as a turn-key, best-in-class digital therapy management system to pharmaceutical customers. To improve the adherence and therefore the therapeutic outcome of selfcare, and to expand its service offering of innovative drug delivery solutions, Ypsomed enters into a first strategic partnership for evidence-based therapy management with digital therapeutics (DTx) innovator Sidekick Health.
Ypsomed’s injection devices such as the YpsoMate in combination with the SmartPilot will be integrated with Sidekick’s digital therapeutics solution.
The jointly developed self-injection module will include features such as digital support and coaching services around self-administration, needle anxiety and self-management with the aim of evidence-based improvement in adherence to therapy.
The combination of Ypsomed’s device platforms with Sidekick’s digital therapeutics solution will enable us to create new behavioural health interventions and tackle patient-specific challenges</p>
