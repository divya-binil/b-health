<p>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's position on telehealth prescriptions has been changing, with indications that the agency may be interested in long-term flexibility. This, along with other policy changes, directly affects healthcare provider organisations and businesses who provide care virtually through telemedicine. In addition, telepsychiatry continues to advance in the post-public health emergency environment.
