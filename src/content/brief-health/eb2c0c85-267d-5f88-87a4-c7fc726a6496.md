<p>The startup plans to use the capital to improve the platform so larger health systems and organizations can use its tools at scale.
Pattern Health, which offers a platform for building digital health tools, announced it had raised $3.3 million in Series A funding. Pattern provides a no-code platform to help clinicians and researchers create digital health programs like apps, clinical decision support tools and surveys.
Another company focused on growing the number of digital health tools on the market is Redesign Health, which helps build, launch and find funding for startups.</p>
