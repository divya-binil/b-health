<p>Vocal biomarkers have amazing potential in reforming diagnostics.
And as you could have guessed already, vocal biomarkers are medical signs deducted from the features of your voice.
The characteristics of your voice – or as medicine labels them, vocal biomarkers – reveal a lot about your health and help in detecting serious diseases and health risks.</p><p>“Adding voice analysis as a standard element of health screening to current methods could allow businesses and institutions to return to business with more confidence,” explained Dr Shady Hassan, founder and CMO of Vocalis Health in our interview for The Medical Futurist Patreon channel (the only platform aimed at directly supporting our articles and research).
Besides focusing on COVID-screening, Vocalis Health also focuses on various voice-indicating ailments including chronic respiratory and cardiac conditions as well as depression.
In a strategic collaboration with Mayo Clinic, they work on the research and development of new voice-based tools for patient health monitoring, screening and detection.</p>
