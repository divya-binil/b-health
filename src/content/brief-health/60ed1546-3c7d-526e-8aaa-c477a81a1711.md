<p>As we interview Donna Grande, president and CEO of the American College of Preventive Medicine, please join us. We talk about how the U.S. health care system has to be fixed immediately, taking into account things like the high cost of healthcare and discrepancies in care for disadvantaged groups. Donna emphasizes the significance of including doctors trained in preventive medicine in decision-making processes, noting their special aptitudes in public health and health systems thinking. As we examine various remedies and legislative measures to restore our healthcare infrastructure, learn why it is ethically necessary and viable to include these physicians. A significant adjustment is required to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of health care and bring about positive changes due to the growing physician scarcity, rising burnout, and diminishing patient satisfaction.</p>
