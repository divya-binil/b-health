<p>Every healthcare organization knows the importance of reducing hospital readmissions. It’s the perfect example to demonstrate how healthcare gets measured and can be improved. However, while most hospitals and health systems know their readmission number, many don’t know what it takes to reduce that number.&nbsp;<br><br>Specifically, &nbsp;post-acute care facilities and the hospitals lack the ability to share patient data effectively and in a timely way, which was essential to ensuring quality patient care and follow-up, ultimately contributing to significantly reduced hospital readmissions.
In addition to using leading technology to enable clinical data sharing to help meet regulatory requirements, Dr. Grant talks about the importance of having the right organizations and partners available on corresponding platforms to address hospital readmissions.
Dr. Grant also discussed the role of continuous improvement in helping Watershed ensure positive outcomes for patients, which contributes to low numbers of readmissions, and where he sees future opportunities to further reduce hospital readmissions.
If reducing readmissions is a priority for you and your organization and you want to better understand technology’s role in the process, you’ll want to tune in to listen to this interview with Dr. Grant from Watershed Health.</p>
