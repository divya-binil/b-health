<p>Baby boomers are less likely to see therapists or psychiatrists, despite the growing need during the pandemic. Telehealth could help lower those barriers to care.<br><br>It's time we talked about how to address the mental health crisis among older Americans and the healthcare industry's collective responsibility to find accessible solutions.
So what's keeping boomers from addressing mental health?
A range of contributing factors include lingering stigma around mental health among aging generations, difficulties in finding accessible coverage – including a lack of practitioners who accept Medicare – and primary care physicians and other healthcare practitioners who hold on to anachronistic, inaccurate views of mental health as separate from physical health.
The embrace of telehealth options by previously reluctant mental health professionals could help those who have limited access to mental health services due to geographical proximity or mobility issues, which are particularly prevalent among aging people.</p>
