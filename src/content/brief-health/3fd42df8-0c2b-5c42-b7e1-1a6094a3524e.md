<p>When it comes to femtech, digital health has options for women concerned about fertility, pregnancy and period tracking. But there just aren’t a lot of choices for older women who need help with menopause or senior care, said Reenita Das, global client leader&nbsp;healthcare and life sciences at Frost &amp; Sullivan.</p><p>“We need to be really thinking about the needs and challenges of senior women, women over 60,” she said at a presentation at <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/himss-coverage">HIMSS21</a>. “Currently we have very little [in the way of] solutions and products and technologies. Most of our work and growth has been around the fertility and menstruation and pregnancy area.”</p><p>The disparity doesn’t come from lack of need. Women ages 15 to 40, the focus of reproductive health technology, and women over 40, who need menopause and senior care, made up nearly equal parts of the global population in 2020, said Chandni Mathur, senior industry analyst for&nbsp;digital health&nbsp;at Frost &amp; Sullivan.</p><p>She counted only about 20 digital health options for women over 40, while women of reproductive age had more than 100.</p>
