title: 5G has the potential to revolutionize robotic-assisted surgery, improve availability
  of healthcare

Many predict 5G will be game-changing for healthcare, providing organizations with more connection power and faster broadband speeds.

One area where 5G could be especially groundbreaking: remote robotic-assisted surgery.

With the technology, surgeons could potentially perform remote, across-the-globe procedures that are impossible today, according to a report from Fitch Solutions Macro Research, a unit of Fitch Group. Robot-assisted surgery remains a popular alternative to traditional surgery, providing better accuracy and precision.
