<p>More and more healthcare marketers are starting to realize the value of structured content. See how Content as a Service can improve your patient experience while improving your bottom line.<br><br>What exactly is Content as a Service (CaaS)?</p><p>CaaS gives you access to a library of content your organization can use in a variety of ways.

This is often referred to as “structured content” or “modular content” because each piece can be used in an infinite number of ways with other pieces to create a finished product.</p><p>With CaaS, each piece of content is a chunk of text, a graphic, or a video.
