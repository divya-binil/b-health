<p>In vitro diagnostics (IVDs) play a key role in today’s healthcare system. Their importance has been strongly highlighted in the global effort to combat and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Accounting for only 2% of total healthcare spending, IVDs influence over 66% of clinical decision-making.1 They play a crucial role in diagnosing disease, assessing treatment efficacy and patient health status, and/or enabling the prevention of disease.&nbsp;</p><p>IVD’s cover a massive spectrum of conditions, and are such a fundamental aspect of modern medicine that the World Health Organization has designated 122 test categories as essential.2 Despite their tremendous utility, current diagnostic testing has room for improvement.&nbsp;</p>
