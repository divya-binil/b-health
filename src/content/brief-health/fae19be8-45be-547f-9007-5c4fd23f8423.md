– Artificial intelligence algorithms can predict outcomes of COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms in emergency rooms, according to recent research findings published in Radiology: Artificial Intelligence journal.

– Researchers trained the algorithm from data on 338 positive COVID-19 patients between the ages of 21 and 50 by using diverse patient data from emergency departments within Mount Sinai Health System hospitals (The Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, Mount Sinai Queens, and Mount Sinai Brooklyn) between March 10 and March 26.
