<p>As the computer form factor shrank from the size of a room to a laptop, computing “mobility” finally became a reality as devices could be transported anywhere. For over a decade, the laptop continued to shrink while increasing in performance and lowering in price. Mobility became synonymous with portability. However, with the advent of the smartphone, mobility now transcends a single product category and has morphed into an experience. Over a short five years, mobility has become synonymous for “easy,” “convenient,” “enabling,” “engaging”, “meaningful,” “connected” and “accessible.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mobility is no longer a material thing; it is an experience that fits naturally into our daily lives while delivering powerful and improved possibilities.
