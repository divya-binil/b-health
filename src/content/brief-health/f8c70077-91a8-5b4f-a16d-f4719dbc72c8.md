<p>The Innovation Forum, taking place at HIMSS22 European Health Conference and Exhibition, will bring hospital chief information officers (CIOs) and chief digital officers (CDOs) together with healthtech company leaders to discuss the digital transformation of hospitals and hospital chains.
“Then, there are healthtech panels where healthtech leaders say what hospital CIOs should be doing, but there are no CIOs on the panel – so, the idea of this session is to bring senior leaders from both sides together across siloes towards the joint goal of hospital digitalisation.”
“If healthtech leaders know where a hospital is on its digital transformation journey and what its needs are, they can provide better offerings, and if CIOs and CDOs know better what innovators are doing, they can better plan their digital transformation programme,” says Silberzahn.
“The digital transformation journeys of hospitals will be made more successful in the future than they have been in the past,” concludes Silberzahn.</p>
