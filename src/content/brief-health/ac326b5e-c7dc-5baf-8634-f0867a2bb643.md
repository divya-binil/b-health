<p>The new study confirms what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella calls the hybrid work paradox.<br><br>Whatever <a href="https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/remote-work-commute-office-culture.html">managers previous fears about remote work</a>, the pandemic has proved that most knowledge <a href="https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/new-data-reveals-truth-about-remote-work-productivity.html">workers can get their daily tasks done just as well from their living rooms</a> as from the office. Study after study confirms most people's personal experience that, at least for those without child care, health, or other challenges, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/yes-working-from-home-makes-you-more-productive-study-finds">productivity has actually inched up</a> with the advent of widespread remote work.&nbsp;</p><p>Which means working from anywhere is a great thing, and companies don't need to worry about its impacts on performance, right?&nbsp;</p><p>Not so fast, suggests a massive new peer-reviewed study from Microsoft that&nbsp;found that, while remote work is fine for plowing through day-to-day work, it has the potential to put a serious damper on collaboration and innovation long-term.&nbsp;</p>
