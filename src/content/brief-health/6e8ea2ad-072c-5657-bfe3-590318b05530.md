<p>Decentralized Clinical Trials (DCTs) have been gaining steam over the last decade, but it was the <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/coronavirus-covid-19/">COVID-19 pandemic </a>that cast its advantages into the limelight. Sponsors benefit by creating efficiencies virtually throughout drug discovery, research, and treatment phases. However, the greatest long-term benefactors will ultimately be the patients.&nbsp;</p><p>Many aspects of traditional clinical trials are inconvenient for potential candidates, including the commute distance to trial sites, time constraints, and lack of consistent protocols to encourage retention. One of the most glaring issues of traditional trials is perhaps the most transformative benefit to employing DCTs— access.&nbsp;</p><p>Socioeconomic barriers continue to stifle traditional clinical trials. Hidden costs such as travel, childcare costs, and lost wages are the most notable factors1. Perhaps that’s why the U.S population’s participation in clinical studies is slim. A 2019 trial <a href="https://www.reportlinker.com/p05770024/Patient-Recruitment-and-Retention-Services-Market.html?utm_source=PRN">study</a> estimates that 80% of trials don’t meet participant enrollment deadlines. What’s more, an average of 30% of trial participants will drop out before the trial’s end2.</p>
