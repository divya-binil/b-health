<p>A increasing number of businesses are addressing challenging issues in healthcare. They require insiders like doctors on their teams if they are to be successful. At the same time, an increasing number of doctors are searching for lucrative alternate professions outside the hospital. But, as we have often discovered for ourselves, it can be challenging to locate the proper people. Given that medical education prepares students for clinical care and scientific research but not for innovative management and engineering, this really shouldn't come as a surprise. Doctors who combine clinical expertise with digital business savvy are what's requiredâ€”hybrids. They're becoming more common in healthcare start-ups; they're sometimes referred to as "Chief Medical Officers," "Medical Directors," or "Medical Experts," but there isn't yet a clear, accepted definition of their roles. There is also no well-established route.</p>
