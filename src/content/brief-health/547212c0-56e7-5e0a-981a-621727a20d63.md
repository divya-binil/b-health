<p>Clinical-grade wearables include regulated devices and supporting platforms that are generally certified/approved for use by one or more regulatory or health authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
RPM comprises all home monitoring devices and sensors used for chronic disease management, which involves continuous monitoring of physiological parameters to support long-term care in a patient’s home to slow disease progression; acute home monitoring, for continuous observation of discharged patients to accelerate recovery time and prevent re-hospitalization; and medication management, to provide users with medication reminders and dosing information to improve adherence and outcomes.
Logistics involves the transport and delivery of healthcare goods and services including pharmaceuticals, medical and surgical supplies, medical devices and equipment, and other products needed by care providers.
The in-clinic segment includes IoMT devices that are used for administrative or clinical functions (either in the clinic, in the telehealth model, or at the point of care).
Examples include Rijuven’s Clinic in a Bag, which is a cloud-based examination platform for clinicians to assess patients at any point of care; ThinkLabs’ digital stethoscope; and Tytocare’s comprehensive telehealth patient examination device for the heart, lungs, ears, skin, throat, and abdomen, which also can measure temperature.
Innovative devices include Zoll’s wearable defibrillator, which continuously monitors patients at risk of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation; Stanley Healthcare’s hand hygiene compliance system, which incorporates an occupancy sensor and a real-time location system receiver to track the identity of employees using the dispenser and uses analytics to determine whether employees are following hygiene protocol; and Boston Children’s Hospital’s GPS-based MyWay app, which guides visitors to their destination using the quickest route.</p>
