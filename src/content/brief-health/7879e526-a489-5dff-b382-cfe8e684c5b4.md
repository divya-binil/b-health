<p>According to a forecast by professional services company KPMG, health IT acquisitions are anticipated to be at prepandemic levels in 2023, with an uptick in activity for middle-market enterprises in the $200 million to $1 billion range.</p><p>From the 2023 KPMG Healthcare and Life Sciences Investment Outlook, which was released on Jan. 9 and questioned 311 corporate and private equity deal-makers, the following six more health IT themes are presented:</p><p>1. According to the majority of survey participants, the need for health IT will be driven by the transition to value-based care and continued waste-reduction initiatives.</p><p>2. New wearable or monitoring gadgets, data mapping for clinical trials, and Oracle Cerner's envisioned health management software are a few further trends that are anticipated for 2023.</p><p>3. A large number of health IT acquisitions in 2023 are anticipated to aid payers and providers in enhancing productivity, clinical trial outcomes, and clinical care.</p><p>4. Artificial intelligence and machine learning, natural language processing, HIPPA-compliant voice and chatbot applications, telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, data interoperability, cloud computing, chronic disease management, data monetization, and blockchain will be the most revolutionary technological trends in 2023.</p><p>5. Increased innovation, payers and providers looking for goods and services that help save costs, and a turbulent stock market making mergers and acquisitions more alluring than public offerings are some positive factors for health IT.</p><p>6. The market for telehealth and several other consumer-facing technology is saturated, and there are significant budgetary constraints that may prevent some companies from investing in health IT.</p>
