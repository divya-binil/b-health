<p>LAS VEGAS – At HIMSS21 earlier this month, Dr. Robert Bart, who has served as the chief medical information officer at Pittsburgh-based UPMC <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/upmc-names-robert-bart-cmio-will-focus-health-records-clinical-tech">since 2017</a>, spoke with <i>Healthcare IT News</i> about his to-do list during this busy past year and a half, and what he's eyeing in terms of clinical priorities as he looks toward the next year and beyond.</p><p>Among the topics we discussed: the value of voice recognition, the path toward effective decision support, building a bigger comfort level for machine learning and the future of value-based contracting.</p><p><strong>Q. We just wrapped up a series at HITN focused on CIOs and CMIOs nationwide, and the </strong><a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/projects/health-it-lessons-learned-during-chaotic-covid-era"><strong>lessons they've learned over the past 18 months of the pandemic</strong></a><strong>. What have been some of yours?</strong></p><p><strong>A.</strong> I don't know if there's something called post-pandemic. I'm not personally convinced yet. But I think probably the thing that I've learned the most in the past 18 months is just the adaptability of people. People still needed to receive care, and clinicians felt it was their duty to deliver care. We were one of those organizations that flipped over to telemedicine pretty seamlessly.</p>
