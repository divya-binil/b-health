    description: >-
      We were motivated to start Carium by the realization that something had to
      change. People lack the information, support, and encouragement they need
      to seek healthcare services, and to make healthy, informed decisions every
      day.


      Our team was purpose-built to catalyze powerful change, with expertise in
      clinical transformation, patient engagement, behavior change science, and
      cutting-edge technology.

The PandemicX Accelerator, co-led by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT, is tasked with using digital tools and publicly accessible data to reduce the disparities and inequity worsened by the novel coronavirus.
