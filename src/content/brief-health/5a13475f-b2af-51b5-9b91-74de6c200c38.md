<p>RCM Intelligence has been introduced, according to Inovalon, a major developer of cloud-based software solutions for data-driven healthcare. This software system provides healthcare providers with a thorough perspective of revenue cycle management (RCM) key performance metrics, including payer performance, rejection percentages, and claim adjustments. It is powered by integrated analytics and powerful visualisation features. In order to inspire decisive action that improves financial performance and frees up clinicians to concentrate on patient care, this solution also visualises month-over-month payment trends and cash flow estimates. The capacity to quickly pinpoint operational problems causing revenue leakage and precisely forecast cashflow each month is business-critical as healthcare providers deal with shrinking operating margins. RCM Intelligence provides providers with the real-time insights necessary to assess, manage, and resolve claims in conjunction with the EASETM All-Payer claims management solution.</p>
