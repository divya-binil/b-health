From wearables to new machine learning applications, advanced technologies can help improve the inpatient experience, says Rebecca Pinn of EPAM Continuum.

**Talking points:**

How hospital stays can be challenging for patients, and the pain points that could be improved with relatively simple technology.

How overworked and understaffed nurses and physicians could also benefit.

Pinn&#39;s own experience during a recent month-long stay, what she learned there.

The ways intrusive monitoring, interrupted sleep, confusing medical records could be approached differently with tech-enabled workflow changes.

Advice for getting clinical staff onboard with and comfortable with these non-clinical processes and tools.
