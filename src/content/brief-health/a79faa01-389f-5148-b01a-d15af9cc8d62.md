<p>When a CIO looks at their healthcare organization, they see hundreds of opportunities to improve their processes and better leverage technology.&nbsp; Balancing all of those competing IT projects that can provide value to their organization and improve the workflow for clinicians and patients is what makes being a CIO so challenging.</p><p>One example of a project that often gets overlooked, yet can provide value to staff and patients, is taking a look at all the forms being used across your organization.&nbsp; What people often don’t realize is that forms spread like wildfire in an organization.&nbsp; It makes sense why.&nbsp; Pretty much anyone can create a form and print it off.&nbsp; It’s not like other technology that has to go through committees and tech experts to be implemented.&nbsp; The slow creep of form proliferation is a real thing in almost every healthcare organization.</p><p>This was the reality for Carl Smith, CIO at King’s Daughters Medical Center, who shared about their experience with forms at the HIMSS 2021 Annual Conference in Las Vegas.&nbsp; Before consolidating their forms and making them all digital, they had 2,500 paper forms in use.&nbsp; After digitizing and consolidating those forms, they were able to reduce them to 1,000 digital forms.</p>
