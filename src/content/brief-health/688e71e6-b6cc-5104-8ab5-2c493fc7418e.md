<p>The new Arch Collaborative Nursing Guidebook 2022 contains data on best practices for engaging nurses on EHR mastery.<br><br>Nearly 16,000 nurses across 35 healthcare organizations responded to a survey about their EHR experience, with results found in KLAS Research's Arch Collaborative Nursing Guidebook 2022.
"Many would benefit from re-evaluating how their training and education programs prepare nurses for their day-to-day EHR use while also weathering inevitable EHR and related environmental changes," the researchers say.
Communications and engagement strategy best practices, including nursing representation in IT, use of superusers, and governance and EHR changes.
Chief among the engagement strategies are recommendations to include nurses in EHR governance and decision-making because organizations with multi-disciplinary teams see higher EHR satisfaction.
Allowing frontline nurses to make EHR requests is also best practice, according to the guidebook.</p>
