<p>The toolkits are based on the Digital Medicine Society's Sensor Data Integrations project, which includes organizations like Amazon Web Services, Oracle, the Moffitt Cancer Center, Takeda and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
The Digital Medicine Society (DiMe) on Monday revealed four toolkits to help healthcare and life science organizations use data from sensors like wearables and remote patient monitoring systems at scale.
The four toolkits are based on resources derived from the society's Sensor Data Integrations project, which includes organizations like Amazon Web Services, Oracle, the Moffitt Cancer Center, Takeda and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
Goldsack said using sensors for patient care isn't necessarily a technology challenge, but it is an implementation one.
If organizations want to use sensor data effectively, a logical clinical workflow is necessary, Goldsack said.
Goldsack said the sensor data integration work builds on DiMe's earlier efforts.</p>
