<p>The healthcare sector has experienced a continuous rise in digital health solutions over the years, a transformation that has only been fast-tracked by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, almost overnight, patient care leaders took action, converting standard in-person care into virtual care delivery in many instances due to shelter-in-place orders and the cancellation of many non-elective procedures at the onset of the crisis. This rapid evolution has impacted the entire healthcare ecosystem, as clinicians were thrusted into a new digital environment.</p><p>On the patient side, even prior to the pandemic, they were becoming more consumer-savvy, and now, theyâ€™re increasingly becoming more likely to take their medical care, and the costs associated with it, into their own hands. One <a href="https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/covid-19/news/21164687/providers-beware-patients-say-theyll-flee-if-covid-expectations-arent-met">recent report from Accenture</a> found that two out of three patients said they are likely to switch to a new healthcare provider if their expectations for managing COVID-19 are not met. These include sanitary and safety protocols, access to up-to-date information and the availability of virtual care options. Based on a survey of more than 4,600 U.S. respondents, the report concluded that patients are looking for a safer, more secure and convenient healthcare experience. In addition, those who believe their healthcare providers handled COVID-19 poorly (25 percent of respondents) were three times more likely than satisfied patients to say they will either delay seeking services for at least a year or never return to that healthcare provider.</p>
