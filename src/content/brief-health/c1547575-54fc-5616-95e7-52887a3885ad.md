<p>CHICAGO – Two generative artificial intelligence announcements from electronic health record vendors – Epic and eClinicalWorks – using Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service, launched in March – coincided with HIMSS23.</p><p>EHR and customer relationship management platforms – like Salesforce, which announced its Einstein GPT for CRM in early March – are integrating generative AI into their software to allow provider organizations to search and summarize contextual information with natural language searches powered by cloud computing.</p><p>With Azure, EHR developers can integrate custom large language model experiences directly into their own applications,&nbsp;<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/chatgpt-is-now-available-in-azure-openai-service/">according to Microsoft</a>. They can imbibe existing bots and other tools with the power to use conversational language "to make life simple for end users," as eClinicalWorks described it Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
