<p>Reduce the complexity of device fleet management to deliver seamless mission-critical care. In the delivery of critical care, every second counts. To win the race against time in emergency situations, an increasing number of healthcare providers are turning to device-based technologies. Care may now be delivered more effectively and efficiently than ever thanks to innovations such as point-of-care gadgets the size of a palm, emergency room registration kiosks, and drones that carry supplies. Yet, how these healthtech gadgets are set up, maintained, and updated could completely alter how they work. Their performance must be ensured whether they are attending to a patient in an emergency room or at the scene of an accident. And you may achieve that by using the appropriate device management options. Having control over your device fleet is essential when saving lives is mission-critical. A scenario can be drastically exacerbated by a broken app or a device with the incorrect settings.</p>
