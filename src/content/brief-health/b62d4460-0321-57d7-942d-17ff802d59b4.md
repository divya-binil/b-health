<p>The investment in its EHR will transform how it delivers care and manages revenue cycle across the enterprise, Northwell says. To adopt the next-generation electronic health record for the healthcare system, Northwell Health has established a partnership with Epic, a provider of medical records software. One patient record will be created as a result of the endeavour, according to Northwell, which is a part of a larger digital transformation effort. The first go-live for the new EHR is anticipated for 2025, according to the health system. "Implementing Epic at Northwell will entail a multi-year effort re-visioning the consumer experience, clinical workflow, and standards followed by configuration and ultimately activation," stated Joseph Moscola, PA, executive vice president of Enterprise Services at Northwell. We are beginning an exciting journey of digital transformation, which includes employing Google Cloud to get data insights.</p>
