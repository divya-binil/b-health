<p>Tufts Medicine this week announced that it has succeeded in deploying its digital health ecosystem in the cloud, moving more than 40 disparate applications and its Epic electronic health record to an Amazon Web Services-hosted environment. With AWS, Tufts was able to move more than 3 million health accounts into Epic EHR in "record time," according to the announcement. This cloud-based digital health ecosystem is also boosting provider and patient experience in other ways. "By undertaking the process of migrating more than 300 applications to AWS, we are providing a personalized, connected care experience for our patients, as well as a data-driven, modern clinical environment," said Dr. Shafiq Rab, chief digital officer and chief information officer at Tufts Medicine.</p>
