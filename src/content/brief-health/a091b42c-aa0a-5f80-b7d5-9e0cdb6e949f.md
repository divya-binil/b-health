<p>Patients want convenience, health insights and easy access to quality care – and they want providers to offer safe, innovative digital experiences, one health IT expert contends. The COVID-19 pandemic brought telemedicine technology and services to a mainstream audience – like it or not.
As it turned out, studies have shown that a great many patients and providers like the flexibility that telemedicine affords.
In a discussion with Healthcare IT News, Fobare spells out the role telemedicine has grown to play during the pandemic, where healthcare goes with telehealth, how change may affect physicians and what virtual care might look like 10 years from now. With telemedicine, healthcare providers could establish connections with a diverse array of patients from various economic backgrounds, age groups and locations.
Advanced device integration will allow data flow between the providers' EHR and patients' personal devices.
In addition, virtual care also offers more flexibility to the provider to backfill last-minute cancellations, providing patients with a more accessible opportunity to be seen quicker. This integrated ecosystem will provide patients and providers with real-time insights into patient health and enhance preventative care measures.
Telemedicine offers a future where patients and providers are empowered with health information.
Imagine an app where patients can easily reference their healthcare records, insights and personalized recommendations, while also allowing providers to check progress in real time and offer feedback.</p>
