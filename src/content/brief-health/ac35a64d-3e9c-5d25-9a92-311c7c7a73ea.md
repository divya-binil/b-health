<p>In order to enhance the patient experience during uncomfortable or anxiety-inducing medical procedures, XRHealth, the top healthcare metaverse platform, and HTC VIVE, the world's top premium virtual reality (VR) platform, today introduced a new distraction treatment virtual reality platform. The new system combines HTC's VIVE Flow glasses with the XRHealth software and is intended to distract patients and lessen pain and anxiety during difficult medical procedures like chemotherapy, surgery, MRIs, and insulin injections as well as the traumatic process of giving birth and burn injuries, among many others. Through guided meditation and other activities, virtual reality distraction therapy takes the patient into a virtual world and gives them the tools they need to manage their pain and anxiety. A study based on the XRHealth platform was just published in PLOS One.</p>
