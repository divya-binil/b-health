The 21st Century Cures Act established new standards for data interoperability and patient involvement in data collection, access, and usage as part of the transition to value-based, patient-centered care. The ability to convert patient-provided data into evidence and make that evidence readily available in the form of clinical guidelines that assist both patients and clinicians in making decisions are two key components of a successful transition to value-based patient-centered care. This Viewpoint article summarises recent research on the technical landscape for patient-centered clinical decision support (PC CDS): advancements, gaps, and difficulties from the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA). Clinical recommendations are often provided to doctors using CDS technologies, which have historically been distributed at the point of care.
