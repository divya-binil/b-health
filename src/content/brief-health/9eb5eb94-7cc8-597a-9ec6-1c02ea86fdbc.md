<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has driven a massive realignment to virtualized work and interactions, giving hackers a larger attack surface. Even more worrisome are potential security challenges around the therapeutics and vaccines developed to fight the virus. The intellectual property involved is of enormous interest to both state actors and the black and gray markets for vaccine development and distribution. Essential information from government health authorities is also under threat from hackers stoking rumors and purposeful disinformation, along with a wide array of scams and fear-based attacks.</p>
