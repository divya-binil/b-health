<p>HIMSS Market Intelligence conducted two benchmarking studies, late 2019 and a follow-up late 2020, sponsored by BD, to explore how connected medication management is transforming medication management overall. The results of the 2020 survey* titled <i>Transforming Medication Management: Insights on Connected Medication Management</i> made it clear that the 50% of hospitals and health systems that were classified in the lowest two categories on a 1 to 4 scale that measures connected medication management performance could benefit from focusing on making improvements to process efficiencies.1</p><p>What’s considerably murkier for many of these organizations is exactly how they should proceed.</p><p>“Organizational leaders need to understand if there are any gaps in the medication management process and identify where there are opportunities for improvement,” said Anna Schoenbaum, DNP, RN, Assistant Vice President, Information Systems, Penn Medicine. “For example, it’s really important to understand that your organization is successful at distribution but might need to improve dispensing or turnaround time. Relying on metrics at each point of the process can help determine where there are opportunities for improvement.”</p>
