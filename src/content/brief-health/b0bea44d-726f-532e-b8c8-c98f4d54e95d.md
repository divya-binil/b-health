<p>Today, the United States is home to more than 6,500 medical technology (MedTech) businesses that are all committed to revolutionising the healthcare sector by creating new tools that lead to better patient diagnosis and treatment. Over the course of two decades, these cutting-edge technologies have had a huge impact, contributing to a 60% drop in patient-days spent in hospitals. There is increased attention being paid to MedTech and its role in enhancing health outcomes as more Americans place a higher priority on their health and wellness and as the healthcare sector undergoes a digital transition due to the pandemic. Companies must be aware of the precise needs and wants of patients when chances to improve patient care and outcomes through new technology arise.&nbsp;</p>
