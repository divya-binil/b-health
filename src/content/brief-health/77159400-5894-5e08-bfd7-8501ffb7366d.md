<p>The role of Chief Data Scientist is emerging as a key member of the C-Suite in healthcare systems as we embrace digital transformation and the use of data science in healthcare.
As a Chief Data Scientist yourself, why do you think this role is important for hospitals?
Itâ€™s still rather new for a health system to have a Chief Data Scientist role.
There could be a research effort as well as part of this Chief Data Scientist role.
To think of what a digital therapeutic looks like is another component of what could fall under a Chief Data Scientist role.</p>
