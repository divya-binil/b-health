      We're a telehealth company dedicated to healthcare innovation. Our leading
      eConsult platform provides a telehealth solution that empowers primary
      care providers with clinical workup checklists and the ability to conduct
      electronic consults (also known as e-consults, eConsults or virtual
      consults) to significantly improve the patient referral process and allow
      greater access to timely, high-quality care. 


      Designed to seamlessly integrate into clinical workflows, the eConsult
      platform allows payers and providers to quickly and cost-effectively
      launch specialist eConsults using their own specialists or those provided
      by AristaMD's contracted panel of board-certified specialists.


      The solution has proven to deliver cost-effective, timely access to
      specialty care through eConsults, significantly reducing the need for
      face-to-face visits. Committed to driving better health outcomes, AristaMD
      partners with healthcare stakeholders to ensure their success in the
      transition to value-based care.
