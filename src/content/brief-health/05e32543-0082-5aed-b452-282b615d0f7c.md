<p>Dr. David Nace, Chief Medical Officer at Innovaccer, talks about what happens when providers bring patients’ clinical and care episodes to the forefront of a tailored patient engagement journey.<br><br>David Nace, MD, Innovaccer’s Chief Medical Officer, talks about what happens when providers bring patients’ clinical and care episodes to the forefront of a tailored patient engagement journey.</p><p><strong>Today’s healthcare consumers expect their care experiences to be highly personalized, similar to their interactions with companies like Netflix, Amazon and Uber. What are providers doing to personalize care?</strong></p><p>The healthcare industry could be doing more. If you go back 30 years, healthcare was a more personalized experience. It was relationship-dependent, not driven by technology like it is today. We now have a fragmented array that consumers struggle to navigate. It’s become impersonal, and even though we have advanced technologies and lots of specialists, the core patient relationship gets lost.</p><p>All the companies you mentioned – Uber, Netflix, Amazon – offer convenience. And to some degree, they give consumers a personalized experience. None of that was provided in healthcare until the pandemic. I still have to take half a day off of work to visit my physician. I still fill out forms when I get there because they don’t remember who I am or the pertinent things to know about me.</p>
