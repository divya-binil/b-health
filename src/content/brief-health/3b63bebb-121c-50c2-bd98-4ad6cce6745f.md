<p><strong>What You Should Know:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>– <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en">Accenture</a> published Fast-Forwarding Healthcare through Data Collaboratives Report to discover how best health ecosystem players access data to fast-forward healthcare.</p><p>– Data generated by technical and scientific advances, like connected health devices, consumer health and medical-grade digital apps, individual multi-omics profiling data and the move to cloud storage, holds great promise for accelerated healthcare progress and precision medicine, and data collaboratives (DCs) might be the path forward. This report takes a closer look into DCs with a specific focus on oncology, as one of the largest therapeutic areas in terms of industry spending and new medications’ launch pipelines.</p><p><strong>Understanding the Potential Data Collaboratives Hold to Generate Value in Healthcare</strong></p><p>Life sciences companies increasingly use DCs to access high-quality data from ecosystem partners. The aim is to accelerate research and early development (R&amp;D), clinical development, and post-launch insight generation. To better understand the extent, implications, and potential benefits of DCs, a survey was conducted &nbsp;among 59 people who are heads of oncology and institutional review board (IRB) members. Of those surveyed, two-thirds already participate in DCs, and the remainder does not. This quantitative research was supported with qualitative research among 18 cross-industry experts (pharma &amp; MedTech, technology service providers, cancer registries, research institutions, patient communities). The research was conducted across the US and the top five EU countries.</p><p>Oncology was deliberately selected for a close look into the therapeutic implications of DCs as it is one of the largest therapeutic areas (TAs)3 in terms of industry spending and new medications’ launch pipelines. The outcomes of the findings could apply across TAs. First, the researchers wanted to understand oncologists’ key DC participation drivers—including their preferred ecosystem setups. Then we profiled the key challenges involved in establishing DCs. Challenges to success were assessed and accelerator were looked at, along with, success factors, and strategies vital to effective DC establishment.<br><a href="https://hitconsultant.net/2023/03/16/accelerated-healthcare-progress-and-precision-medicine/">Read on hitconsultant.net</a></p>
