<p>The threat COVID has posed ever since it first appeared influenced how healthcare operates on many levels. It triggered a rapid expansion in health technology – some obvious, like the <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/covid-19-was-needed-for-telemedicine-to-finally-go-mainstream">rise of telemedicine</a> or <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/the-rise-of-at-home-lab-tests">at-home lab tests</a>, others filled a much-needed immediate void. The demand for safe solutions inclined the development of robotic support in hospitals – and drones.</p><p>I must admit, I expected the rise of drone-based solutions years ago (and I <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30361-0/fulltext">wasn’t alone</a> with my expectations). By now, we are just at the very beginning of using drones in healthcare. And still, even now, when COVID-19 clearly showed the necessity for them, drones don’t seem to break through and stay with us in the new normal.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.unicef.org/supply/media/5286/file/%20Rapid-guidance-how-can-drones-help-in-COVID-19-response.pdf">UNICEF guidance note</a>, the organisation identifies three basic types of potential use cases for drones:<br>(1) delivery and transportation;&nbsp;(2) aerial disinfection, and (3) public space monitoring. During the pandemic, we have seen examples for all three cases – and more. Let’s see what the options are for drones in the future.</p>
