<p>It's been quite a year for digital, from Akili's de novo clearance to the downfall of 'digital pill' maker Proteus. MobiHealthNews takes a look back at the highlights.<br><br>The life science world has continued to deepen its interest in the digital space. While the mainstream life science news of the year was research on the coronavirus vaccine, when it came to digital the industries efforts were more varied. We saw new partnerships between pharma and digital health around topics such as respiration health, cardiovascular conditions and real-world data.&nbsp;</p><p>This year we’ve also seen a number of new&nbsp;digital therapeutics on the market. In fact, in April the <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/fda-devs-can-release-digital-products-psychiatric-disorders-without-510k-submission-during">FDA released new guidance on digital health devices</a> for treating psychiatric disorders that waives several regulatory requirements – such as the need to submit a 510(k) premarket notification – for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency. During this period we saw both Pear Therapeutics and Akili Interactive Labs take advantage of this early release.&nbsp;</p><p>Another major area of interest this year was digital pharmacies. This year we saw GoodRx and Hims go public, signaling more consumer interest in the space.</p>
