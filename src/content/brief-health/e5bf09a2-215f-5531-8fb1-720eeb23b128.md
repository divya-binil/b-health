<p>Genome sequencing does definitely not equal fortune telling: it cannot predict how long you will live or what your body mass index will look like. However, it can tell you a lot about your sensitivity to drugs, your family history or whether you are a carrier of monogenic conditions.</p><p>After the Human Genome Project was completed 20 years ago (for a whopping $2.7 billion), the dream was to be able to sequence a person’s genome for 1000 USD. After this became feasible, the next dream was to make it even cheaper: now it costs around 200 USD after<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-era-of-fast-cheap-genome-sequencing-is-here/"> Illumina’s innovation came to life</a>.</p><p>What is the next dream? To be able to analyse the data and draw clinical conclusions from that.</p>
