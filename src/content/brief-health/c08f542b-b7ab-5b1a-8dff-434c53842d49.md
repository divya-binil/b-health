<p>They have so far developed AI prediction models for breast, colon, and lung cancers.
Researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras have come up with a new AI prediction tool that can detect cancer-causing genes in individuals. The researchers have so far developed AI prediction models for three cancer types: breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. Additionally, the research team is building a list of cancer-causing genes to help identify suitable drugs for patients based on their cancer profile.
While there are existing tools that can also identify cancer genes, these use unsupervised learning and base their prediction on the presence and absence of mutations in those genes.</p>
