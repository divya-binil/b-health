    title: Upfront Healthcare
    description: >-
      Healthcare models are ever-changing and complicated. Both patients and
      providers need a single, scalable, and automated way to personalize
      navigation regardless of payment model, risk level, condition, payer,
      profile or demographics. With no clear solution in sight for this ongoing
      need, co-founders Ben Albert and Carrie Kozlowski combined their tenured
      experience in healthcare technology and their entrepreneurial drive to
      create Upfront Healthcare.


      Upfront’s platform automates and personalizes care navigation to
      efficiently engage all patients, optimize sites of care, grow necessary
      visit completion and improve outcomes. Upfront combines advanced
      analytics, personalization, content, and outreach to give every patient
      the personalized experience they require and health systems the ROI they
      desire.

The combination of both platforms allows healthcare organizations to create better digital experiences for their patients using Kyruus’ powerful provider search, match, and scheduling capabilities coupled with continued engagement through Upfront’s personalized, omnichannel communication streams.</p><p>The partnership announcement comes at a time when many people have skipped or delayed care as a result of the pandemic, with<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kyruus.com%2Fpatient-access-post-pandemic-report-lp&amp;esheet=52692522&amp;newsitemid=20220421005299&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=more+than+half+of+consumers&amp;index=3&amp;md5=2c83bf7989829f10bedbb4673cf4876a">&nbsp;more than half of consumers</a>&nbsp;saying they’ve held off on accessing some type of care (e.g., routine, specialty, mental health, or surgical care). Nevertheless, consumers continue to rely on healthcare provider organizations as a trusted resource in their search for care. Kyruus and Upfront’s collaboration will benefit healthcare organizations and patients alike, helping connect people with the care they need and ultimately closing gaps in care.</p><p>“Upfront’s partnership with Kyruus represents a tremendous opportunity to fundamentally shift the patient experience,” said Ben Albert, CEO and co-founder of Upfront. “By joining forces, we are helping healthcare organizations engage and drive people to the right care and build loyalty by deepening trusted relationships with their patients well beyond the first visit – bolstering care quality, satisfaction, and completed visits.”</p><p>Healthcare organizations will be able to create end-to-end patient acquisition and retention strategies, leveraging the&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kyruus.com%2F&amp;esheet=52692522&amp;newsitemid=20220421005299&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Kyruus+ProviderMatch&amp;index=4&amp;md5=03cd16cc1f6b6a05721d3632c3150711">Kyruus ProviderMatch</a>®&nbsp;platform to enable consumers to find and schedule all types of care within a single experience, and then utilizing Upfront’s customized microsites, landing pages, and SMS messages to further activate patients before, after, and between visits. The combined offering will connect people with the right care the first time while also reducing no-show rates and encouraging access to key preventative services on a regular basis.</p><p>“Engaging patients to ensure they receive necessary care on a regular basis is critical to ensuring the health and wellbeing of the communities we serve,” said Dr. Nick Patel, Chief Digital Officer at Prisma, a joint customer of Kyruus and Upfront. “The ability to guide patients to the right care with Kyruus’ ProviderMatch for Consumers coupled with Upfront’s communications platform allows us to keep patients engaged and provide a personalized experience that increases satisfaction and enhances retention simultaneously.”</p><p>“Kyruus’ dedication to making healthcare better for everyone really starts with connecting people to the right care at the right time in the right place,” said Gail Airasian, General Manager for Emerging Markets at Kyruus. “Through our partnership with Upfront, we are able to deepen our impact with healthcare organizations—and the patients they serve—by helping them guide patients to the care they need and then enabling them to develop and maintain those relationships well after they schedule that first appointment online.”</p><p><strong>About Upfront</strong></p><p>Upfront is a mission-driven healthcare company, delivering tangible outcomes to leading healthcare systems and provider groups. Our patient communication and engagement platform makes each patient feel seen, guiding their care experience through personalized digital outreach.
