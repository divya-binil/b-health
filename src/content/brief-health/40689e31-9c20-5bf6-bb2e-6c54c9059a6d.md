<p>“We expect to see a huge shift towards virtual wards and remote patient monitoring in homes and care homes to support people with long-term conditions as the NHS works towards preventing avoidable hospital admissions and providing better care at home.
It’s been encouraging to see social care policy starting to receive the attention it requires, and we are looking forward to this focus increasing to support the drive to join up health and social care across whole ICSs.”
“In days gone by, hospitals, health systems, and other care providers viewed technology vendors as exactly that—companies that supplied the digital tools they were asked to provide.
Instead of waiting to fulfil specific requests, partners work proactively to help guide care providers‘ digital strategies and find creative solutions to emerging challenges like:
“That should drive a new wave of digital transformation, so we expect to be busy helping the new customers that chose Orion Health for a shared care record this year to deploy their platforms and helping existing customers to move from ‘viewing’ data to ‘doing’ analysis and care co-ordination.
This is being demanded in the NHS through initiatives which will help drive forward innovation and change such as the Digital Aspirant Plus programme, and through structural changes such as the formal introduction of Integrated Care Systems.
“Technology suppliers must continue to work with clinical colleagues to ensure solutions we provide make their lives easier, freeing them up to spend more time caring for patients.
In 2022, we’ll see continued progress in sharing health data within ICSs, which will make a huge difference to clinicians and patients across care settings.
In Allscripts’ role as a solution provider, we’re committed to supporting regional systems to integrate and helping leaders create the right culture for technology to make a difference.</p>
