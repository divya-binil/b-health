"These rules will improve operations -- in administrative offices and at the point of care -- and will enhance the experience for all stakeholders."</p><p><strong>New rules for supplemental documentation attachments</strong><br>The new CAQH CORE <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3510465-1&amp;h=3916547921&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.caqh.org%2Fcore%2Fcaqh-core-prior-authorization-referrals-operating-rules&amp;a=Prior+Authorization">Prior Authorization</a> and <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3510465-1&amp;h=3365328707&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.caqh.org%2Fcore%2Fcaqh-core-health-care-claims-operating-rules&amp;a=Health+Care+Claim">Health Care Claim</a> Attachments Operating Rules enable providers to send to health plans documentation to support a claim or prior authorization in a uniform, electronic format using industry standards.
