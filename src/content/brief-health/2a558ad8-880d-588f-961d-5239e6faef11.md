<p>In 2016, the World Health Organization predicted that there would be a global shortage of approximately 18 million health workers by 2030. While significant steps are being made by healthcare management to reduce this shortage, we cannot ignore the further damage and setbacks created by COVID-19.
Dr. Vin Gupta, health technology executive, policy expert, and medical analyst for NBC News and MSNBC, shares his thoughts on the current strategies and potential areas where healthcare leaders may focus to relieve staffing pressures and manage the increasing demand for care effectively.
Dr. Vin Gupta: &nbsp;Countries that don’t have a seamless way to educate and train future generations of healthcare workers should expect these dynamics to worsen due to the lack of progressive policies enabling greater education access in the healthcare fields.
 Healthcare executives of large care delivery organizations should be thinking big about what the future healthcare worker wants in order to have a fulfilling healthcare career.
Adopt innovations in the digital care space that make it easier for healthcare workers to reach more patients while practicing at the top of their medical licenses.
So it’s important to make sure you have leaders and management that are hiring the best leaders that can help power healthcare innovation strategies and the best patient solutions.
And it’s critical that healthcare executives think broadly about their top-level senior management team in order to really take action on some of these key initiatives that will help with retention.
Lastly, It’s key that we embrace innovation to provide different opportunities for career growth among healthcare workers.
Care delivery is difficult, and we, as management, have to do more to help and support our healthcare workers.</p>
