<p>Mallory Hackett, the author of this essay from March 9, 2021 titled "Innovative healthcare treatments require innovative payment models," emphasises the demand for cutting-edge payment methods to support the expanding field of sophisticated medical treatments. Traditional payment mechanisms might not sufficiently handle the expenses involved with these cutting-edge therapies as new medical advancements continue to be made.</p><p>The essay emphasizes that the advent of novel treatments and therapies in the future years will put the effectiveness of managing healthcare expenditures to the test. These innovative medical procedures hold considerable potential for enhancing patient outcomes and treating illnesses that weren't previously curable. However, they frequently have high prices that conventional payment systems can find difficult to handle.</p>
