<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is waiving a number of telehealth rules during the COVID-19 public health emergency to encourage physicians to evaluate and treat patients remotely, when possible.</p><p>These rules currently apply to Medicare. Some private payers have followed suit, and the American Academy of Family Physicians is calling on all payers to do the same. Check with payers in your area if you are unsure of their policies.</p><p><br><a href="https://www.aafp.org/journals/fpm/blogs/inpractice/entry/telehealth_rules_waived.html">Read on aafp.org</a></p>
