<p>A corporate spokeswoman claimed that due to the current market and economic constraints, the company "changed staffing numbers and other direct expenses." Approximately seven months after the telehealth business disclosed its $22 million Series A round of funding, Antidote Health acknowledged this week that it had made personnel reductions. According to Calcalist's reporting, the company has laid off nearly a third of its personnel, with its research and development team accounting for the majority of the reductions. Online medicines and refills are available through Antidote, along with virtual primary care, mental healthcare, and hypertension treatment. An Antidote spokesman said in an email to MobiHealthNews that the company has "declared it has altered employee numbers and other direct expenses due to current challenges in the economy and market conditions."</p>
