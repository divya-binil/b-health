September 18, 2019 - Cerner announced five finalists for the 2019 Cerner Open Development Experience (code) App Challenge. The finalists are invited to attend the Cerner Health Conference and code Learning Lab, where they can work with Cerner’s top engineers and developers.

Cerner challenged IT developers to use advanced programming interfaces (APIs) to focus on the consumers’ ability to access, understand and use health information in the EHR.

“We challenge innovators and organizations across the industry to join us in advancing interoperability, secure data exchange and consumer access to health records,” said John Gresham, senior vice president of Health Networks at Cerner. “People should be able to access and understand their own health information regardless of facility or EHR, which is why collaboration through open platforms and shared data is critical to our mission.”
