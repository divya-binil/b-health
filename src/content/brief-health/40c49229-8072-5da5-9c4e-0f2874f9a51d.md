<p>When a woman is confronted with a cancer diagnosis, there seems to be more questions than answers. If cancer is detected at an early stage, treatment can start sooner to ensure better outcomes. The fear of the unknown, such as radiation treatment, could also cause anxiety. However, there is good news.</p><p>As an alternative to a mastectomy or whole breast radiation, <a href="https://healthmanagement.org/site/p/hologic">Hologic</a> offers a breakthrough early stage cancer treatment by way of targeted radiation therapy with balloon brachytherapy. This solution targets the lumpectomy cavity specifically, in other words, the area where the cancer is most likely to recur. By doing so, healthy tissues and organs are spared the damaging effects of radiation.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a choice of two systems, MammoSite® and Contura®. A legacy balloon system, MammoSite® offers two configurations: single lumen and multi-lumen catheters, which has four offset lumens that optimise the dosage to minimise exposure to skin. The balloon is fitted with a stylet that helps the user to position it after implantation.&nbsp;</p><p>The Contura® multi-lumen balloon (five), a single applicator, comes in two sizes and two shaft configurations. The user can move the isodose curve from the chest wall. One can remove fluid or air via the two vacuum ports on the proximal and distal ends of the balloon.&nbsp;</p><p>After seven years, positive clinical data show that over 90 000 women have been treated successfully. The American Society of Breast Surgeons conducted a MammoSite Breast Brachytherapy Registry Trial (N=1440) that showed favourable results regarding treatment efficacy, cosmesis and toxicity.&nbsp;</p>
