<p>The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology has developed a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/Social%20Determinants%20of%20Health%20Information%20Exchange%20Toolkit%202023_508.pdf">toolkit</a>&nbsp;that gathers community engagement, health IT standards, infrastructure, interoperability and governance information to help support communities working to achieve health equity.</p><p><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong></p><p>Non-uniform data collection, varied healthcare system designs and differences in information technology capacities can challenge SDOH service coordination.</p><p>ONC seeks to advance the use of interoperable, standardized data to represent social needs and conditions and in 2021, organized a panel of experts within the health and human service ecosystem to identify key considerations for interoperability and implementation of SDOH information exchange.</p><p>The toolkit is built around community readiness and stewardship, policy, financing, user support and learning networks.</p><p>ONC designed the SDOH Toolkit as a practical guide for collaborative assessment, design, implementation and governance of health IT systems, according to a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/public-health/new-releases-sdoh-toolkit-and-learning-forum-sessions-for-the-health-it-community">blog post</a>&nbsp;announcing its availability.</p><p>Structured around 10 foundational elements, the toolkit includes questions for consideration that can aid community groups and healthcare organizations as they build or expand on SDOH data initiatives.&nbsp;</p><p>"Weâ€™ve designed this resource as a useful starting point for use across sectors, contexts and communities to support efforts to inform health equity and more informed care," said ONC officials.</p>
