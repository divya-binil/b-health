<p>In our new series, Emerging Trends, we are looking at those technologies in digital health that are on a particular ‘hype cycle’ – technologies and solutions that currently stand out from the rest because of their novelty, timeliness, or greatness. These are solutions everyone’s talking about or the ones they should.</p><p>Technological solutions to cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease, in particular, are rising with increasing pipeline drug development, promising biomarkers, and more. Let’s jump right in.</p><p>Liza Marshall was “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/22/man-with-alzheimers-proposes-to-his-wife-after-forgetting-they-were-married-she-said-yes">over the moon</a>” when she said yes to the love of her life in a small ceremony. And it didn’t matter that Peter, then a husband of Liza’s for 12 years, didn’t remember their first marriage at all. Peter Marshall has early-onset Alzheimer’s disease, a condition that affects about 10% of people with this ailment . Gradual memory loss, cognitive decline, wandering off to unknown places, inability to dress up in the morning: living with dementia and its most common form, Alzheimer’s disease, is a heart-wrenching burden for both patients and their loved ones. Yet, as Liza Marshall told the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/06/21/alzheimers-wedding-husband-wife-vow/">Washington Post</a>, “<i>it’s been devastating, but I’ve done my best to stay positive and focus on one day at a time.</i>”</p>
