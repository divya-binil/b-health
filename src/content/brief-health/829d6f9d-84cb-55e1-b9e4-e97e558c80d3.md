<p>Pfizer's choices about new treatments will be influenced by the senior health-focused statistics from PointClickCare. To share its real-world data on elders, PointClickCare, a Canadian health IT startup, and Pfizer have formed a strategic partnership. The cloud-based software provider specialises in senior care. The market for long-term and post-acute care is covered. To assist in making decisions about novel medicines, PointClickCare will offer Pfizer real-world data insights that precisely represent older persons, particularly those in long-term care institutions. According to Simon Dagenais, senior director of the Real-World Evidence Center of Excellence at Pfizer, "access to data on comorbidities, medications, vital signs, body weight, and physical function in older adults residing in long-term care through electronic medical records is very important to help us design clinical trials for this patient population."</p>
