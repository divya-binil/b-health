<p>In the AI Special Report published in the Medical Economics Journal's July 2023 issue, author Jordan Rosenfeld explores the significance of ChatGPT and other AI tools for healthcare professionals. The report delves into what doctors need to know about these advanced technologies. &nbsp;The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT, which patients are starting to use to seek answers about their health, may be unsettling and even frightening to many doctors. AI tools are here to stay, according to experts, despite the risks that come with using any tool, and the fact that AI is still developing its capabilities in many aspects. Patients will benefit from their practices being improved by doctors who educate themselves and learn how to use them.&nbsp;</p>
