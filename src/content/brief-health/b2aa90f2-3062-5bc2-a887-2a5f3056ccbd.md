<p>– <a href="https://www.who.int/">The World Health Organization (WHO)</a> launched its first ever global report on:&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1352854/retrieve">Ethics and governance of artificial intelligence for health</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>– While new technologies that use artificial intelligence hold great promise to improve diagnosis, treatment, health research and drug development and to support governments carrying out public health functions, including surveillance and outbreak response, such technologies, according to the report, must put ethics and human rights at the heart of its design, deployment, and use.</p><p>– The report,&nbsp;is the result of 2 years of consultations held by a panel of 20 international experts appointed by WHO. The group analyzed many opportunities and challenges of <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/artificial-intelligence/">AI</a> and recommended policies, principles and practices for ethical use of AI for health and means to avoid its misuse to undermine human rights and legal obligations.</p>
