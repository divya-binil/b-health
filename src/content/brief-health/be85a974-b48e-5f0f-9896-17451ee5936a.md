<p>According to Unite Us specialists, who also provide a thorough analysis of health equity in 2022 and 2023. The healthcare sector's key priorities are health fairness and technological innovation, which are being driven by new standards, technology, and policies. Despite advancements, a recent report from the Yale School of Public Health shows that the country is losing progress in terms of healthcare access, with more hurdles present today than there were two decades ago. The CEO of Unite Us, Dan Brillman, and Melissa Sherry, vice president of social care integration at Unite Us, share their perspectives with Healthcare IT News readers on how these and other issues will likely be resolved in 2023. A digital firm called Unite Us creates networks of social and health service providers that deliver coordinated care.</p>
