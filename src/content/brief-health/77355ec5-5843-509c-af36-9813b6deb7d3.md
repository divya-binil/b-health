<p>Leigh Burchell, VP, Policy &amp; Government Relations, at Allscripts discusses the information blocking rule and what providers need to know.<br><br>Information exchange and data availability are now a cost of doing business but establishing a robust strategy for that exchange and compliance with the new regulation from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology takes careful planning.
“Electronic Health Information,” ONC’s new term for the data elements that need to be “exchangeable” upon request, is currently limited to data elements within the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) standard.
If your organization is unable to exchange all the data elements within the USCDI (now or in the expanded set), you may need to note an exception, which brings us to the next tip.
This individual will be your expert on the rule and its details, thinking through the implications for your organization’s response, identifying the process and location for documentation, and archiving your exceptions in the event of a complaint, as there is no natural place to do so in an electronic health record (EHR).
Should the OIG launch an investigation, demonstrating an organizational commitment to interoperability, including the fact that you trained all team members, could help prove your intention to access and exchange data as requested by patients, other providers, or public health entities.</p>
