<p>As the respiratory disease COVID-19 is caused by a new pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, there is so much uncertainty that makes the battle against the pandemic even more challenging. Experts continue with their research work to have a better understanding on COVID-19's underlying physiology and its interactions with the body's different system processes.</p><p>A global community of researchers have formed the Consortium for Clinical Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR (4CE) – pronounced “foresee” – to help answer some of the clinical and epidemiological questions around COVID-19 through harmonisation and analysis of data stored in electronic health records (EHRs).&nbsp;</p><p>In a recent paper (Brat et al<i>. </i>2020) 4CE, comprising 96 hospitals across five countries, reports that the largely untapped EHR data is helpful in bridging the knowledge gaps about COVID-19. This includes data on incidence, prevalence, case-fatality rates, and clinical predictors of disease severity and outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>The consortium's initial efforts seek to consolidate, share and interpret data about the clinical trajectories of the infection in patients with a first focus on laboratory values and comorbidities. Within a three-week period, 96 hospitals in the United States (45), France (42), Italy (5), Germany (3) and Singapore (1) contributed data to the consortium.</p><p><br><a href="https://healthmanagement.org/c/it/news/4ce-extracting-covid-19-data-from-ehrs">Read on healthmanagement.org</a></p>
