<p>Patients and staff have long been involved in driving and shaping transformation programmes in healthcare. In the NHS, this involvement has often taken the form of patient panels, focus groups and the voice of the patient is often represented in the role of Patient Governor. Patients who have an interest in their healthcare systems also include Trust members and volunteers who form part of a dynamic network.</p><p>As we move to a new phase in digital health, it is believed that digital solutions can support a significant number of patients in taking a more active role in their own care. We have seen this in trends such as wearables, apps and on-demand healthcare solutions. It is also reflected by the programmes of work the recent Digital Pioneer Fellowship cohorts have been undertaking. Healthcare providers have looked to other industries to improve engagement and uptake of these digital solutions, which has resulted in a focus on patients as ‘consumers’ in product development.</p>
