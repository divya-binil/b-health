<p>Schellman, a leading provider of attestation and compliance services, is pleased to announce the introduction of HIPAA Express, a new service offering aimed at reducing the risk of data breaches and ransomware attacks for large healthcare systems and regional healthcare providers. Through this third-party assessment, Schellman can help these organizations protect the considerable amount of sensitive data they maintain, identify evidence of due diligence to comply with HIPAA, and set them up for success in the event of an OCR audit—with the potential to even reduce fines resulting from an OCR breach investigation.
With over 90% of OCR enforcement actions calling out an insufficient HIPAA Risk Analysis / Risk Management program, Schellman made this area a focal point of the HIPAA Express assessment.
Schellman’s new offering includes a workshop and meetings with various levels of an organization, as well as a report that details the summary letter, scope of the environment, details around the essential elements of the HIPAA Security Risk Analysis and Risk Management processes, a table showing the compliance status of requirements, and a detailed description of any findings from the assessment.</p>
