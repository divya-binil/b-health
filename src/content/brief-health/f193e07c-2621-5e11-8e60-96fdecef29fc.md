<p>Health care professionals are being cautioned about the Daixin Team by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It is an organisation that actively targets American firms with ransomware and data extortion activities, mostly in the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector. The FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) revealed that victims were being targeted by the Daixin Team with malware across all 16 critical infrastructure sectors, prompting the release of the latest advisory. Nonetheless, 25% of ransomware attacks were directed against the HPH Sector. In 2021, 649 ransomware reports were filed across 14 critical infrastructure sectors, with the HPH Sector accounting for the majority of incidents, according to an IC3 annual report.</p>
