<p>When it comes to team size, the cliché "less is more" frequently rings true in organizational leadership. Small teams frequently perform better than bigger ones due to their natural communication benefits. Complexity in communication is a characteristic that is increasingly understood to be essential to team success. The topic of communication complexity, its use in health care leadership, and how it affects various team structures, including grand rounds, regular teaching rounds, and C-suite meetings, will all be covered in this article. We will also explore the "two-pizza rule" from Amazon and how it relates to this topic. The complex web of interactions that exists inside a team is referred to as communication complexity. It becomes more challenging to manage and maintain good communication as the team size expands since the number of potential communication channels grows dramatically.&nbsp;</p>
