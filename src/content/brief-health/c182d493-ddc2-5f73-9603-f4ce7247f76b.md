<p>The 17-health-system agreement is meant to provide opportunities for prospective hires who have faced barriers to employment. 17 health organisations, including Cleveland Clinic and Advocate Health, have committed to hiring people from economically disadvantaged areas as 10% of all new recruits, or "impact hires." The "Impact Workforce Commitment," developed in cooperation with a leadership team of Healthcare Anchor Network (HAN) member health systems and the National Fund for Workforce Solutions, aims to open doors for potential employees who, for various reasons, have encountered employment barriers. The majority of the agreement's attention will go to positions that call for less than a bachelor's degree. Low income, limited access to education and training, or other socioeconomic difficulties are relevant issues to take into account. The pledge also aims to reduce racial imbalances and create economic opportunities to enhance social health and wellbeing.</p>
