Companies that can deliver efficiencies for the healthcare system and demonstrate compliance sophistication will be of interest to investors, who are also looking for companies that recognize the regulatory environment and demands of their customers.&nbsp;</p><p>Challenges in accessing complete and accurate data at the point of care and the need for interoperability between systems are some of the issues facing the digital health industry.&nbsp;</p><p>There is also the issue of data privacy and security, as well as the need to address regulatory hurdles and align with the expectations of payers and providers.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="https://medcitynews.com/2022/12/healthcare-private-equity-in-2022-challenges-and-opportunities-for-digital-health-investment/">Read on medcitynews.com</a></p>
