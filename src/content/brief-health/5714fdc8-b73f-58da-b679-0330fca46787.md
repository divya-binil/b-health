<p>Akili, maker of a video game-like digital therapeutic for children with ADHD, hit the public markets Monday after wrapping up a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Social Capital Suvretta Holdings Corp.
Akili said the funds should support at least two years of operations without any revenue from EndeavorRx. "With this milestone completed, Akili has a number of others ahead, including its upcoming commercial launch of EndeavorRx and a strong clinical pipeline of breakthrough digital therapeutic candidates that have the potential to treat a host of cognitive impairments," Chamath Palihapitiya, chairman and CEO of SCS, said in a statement.</p>
