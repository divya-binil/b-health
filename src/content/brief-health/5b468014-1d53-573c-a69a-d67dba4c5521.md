<p>When William Carracino, MD, was chief resident at New York City-based Mount Sinai Hospital Health System, he wrote a computer program to manage patient lists "in a very old software program and a very old hardware computer," he said. As he graduated residency, his former chief of staff gifted him a tie clip shaped like an integrated circuit. Now Dr. Carracino is the chief medical informatics officer at Lee Health in Fort Myers Fla., where he works on the medical informatics team, the technology education team and the digital transformation team.
Dr. Carracino took his expertise to the "Becker's Healthcare Digital Health + Health IT" podcast to talk more about innovations in digital technology, population health and digitally enabling physicians.
There's a difference between a provider who's at odds with the technology versus one who has embraced it and dives into it.</p>
