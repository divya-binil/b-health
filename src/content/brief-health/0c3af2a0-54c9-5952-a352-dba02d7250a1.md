<p>The Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine found that although "telediagnosis" has potential, there's still a lot to learn about how it can work most effectively.<br><br>Researchers from the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine released an issue brief this week aimed at exploring the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and future prospects of telehealth.</p><ul><li>"We found that many patients like the convenience of telemedicine, but we also need more research into who is being left behind in the process, such as small practices or people without access to high-speed Internet," Schrandt continued.</li><li>It partners with stakeholders such as patients, families and members of the healthcare community.</li><li>"One challenge that emerged within each stakeholder group was the difficulty in measuring or evaluating the true impact of telemedicine on quality and safety, and this remains the key research question that needs to be addressed," read the brief.</li><li>In 2017, a report from the National Quality Forum found that 5% or more patients in the U.S are being incorrectly diagnosed, contributing to up to 17% of adverse hospital events.</li></ul>
