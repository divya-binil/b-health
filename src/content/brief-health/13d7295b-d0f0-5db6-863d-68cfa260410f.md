<p>According to a survey by the American Medical Association, 93% of physicians felt there was some advantage or a definite advantage to using digital health tools in 2022, compared with 85% in 2016.
More physicians feel digital health tools are an advantage for patient care, according to a survey by the American Medical Association.
Overall, 93% of physicians surveyed felt there was some advantage or a definite advantage to leveraging digital health tools in 2022, compared with 85% in 2016.
"The physician adoption rate of digital health tools has accelerated as physicians grow increasingly optimistic about the advantages that properly designed digital health tools can have for patient care if key requirements are met," AMA president Dr. Jack Resneck Jr. said in a statement.</p>
