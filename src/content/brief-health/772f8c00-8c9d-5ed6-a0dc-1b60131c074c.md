<p>Providing patients with a positive health outcome is always the priority for their healthcare provider. The journey to accomplishing this goal can often be an uphill challenge with many variables at play. Providers are tasked with not only delivering a positive health outcome but also with the patient experience and level of satisfaction as they make their way through their healthcare journey. Since the Covid-19 pandemic and the emergence of virtual healthcare, the healthcare industry has witnessed dramatic changes in care delivery and the patient experience.</p><p>The pandemic brought forth several issues in healthcare provisions and treatments, including staffing shortages, poor delivery of services, and disparities between the health needs of the population and the competencies of health professionals. The National Institutes of Health (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9140408/">NIH</a>) reports that these challenges have halted or reduced treatments for illnesses like cardiovascular emergencies, hypertension, diabetes, and diabetes-related complications. To correct these inefficiencies – and to ensure positive patient experiences and continued satisfaction – the healthcare industry had to embrace change and implement new strategies.</p><p><strong>Understanding the perception of virtual health care</strong></p><p>In a survey conducted by the Cleveland Clinic, <a href="https://www.jmir.org/2021/6/e18488/">results showed</a> patients found virtual health care to be just as impactful as in-person visits. These positive responses from patients are essential to recognize, as the survey, in its fourth iteration by the J.D. Power group, shows that telehealth usage is up nearly 30% now compared to when the study was conducted in 2019.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://hitconsultant.net/2023/04/10/optimizing-patient-experience-virtual-offerings-healthcare-climate/">Read on hitconsultant.net</a></p>
