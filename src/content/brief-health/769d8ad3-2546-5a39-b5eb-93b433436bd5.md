<p>At the 2023 American Association of Orthopedic Executives (AAOE) conference, Hoag Hospital, a not-for-profit regional health care delivery network in Orange County, California, presented the findings of a two-year analysis. The study showed that, when compared to conventional home health for total knee and hip replacements, the Luna in-home outpatient physical therapy care model saves expenditures by 52%. In order to develop a scalable solution to lower per episode care costs by using in-home outpatient physical therapy instead of conventional home health services, Hoag Orthopedic Institute conducted the study between 2021 and 2023 in partnership with Luna, the top provider of in-home physical therapy. You may view the entire study here. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons notes that healthcare cost is still increasing.</p>
