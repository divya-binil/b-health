**“The future of Clinical Research is AI”!** It’s common place to hear this now a days but what does it mean? We have all heard of how AI is being applied in basic research in identifying molecules, in finding disease patterns in potential patient populations and in Virtual Trials. In this article I will briefly touch upon the various well known and a few lesser-known applications of AI and Automation in the clinical trials process.

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of AI which deals with applying algorithms to data, enabling the system to ‘learn’ and improve. ML allows users to process large quantities of data and make smart inferences and predict outcomes. These insights can be used to automate parts of the system leading to a faster and a more efficient clinical trial system. Automation allows the ML predictions to be fed back into the system and specific actions to be taken, reducing the need for human intervention, and improving quality and speed. ML and automation can be applied across every stage of the trial process.
