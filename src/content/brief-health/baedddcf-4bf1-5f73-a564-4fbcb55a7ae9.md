<p>In their latest expansion, the newly established crypto platform Data Lake is creating a global medical data donation system based on the latest technologies, including blockchain.
Data Lake provides data sets useful for scientific research and medical studies.
The global medical data donation system Data Lake is creating will be a huge support to fields such as &nbsp;Machine Learning (ML), particularly in medical imaging data analysis for disease detection, such as analyzing cancer screenings, and the potential to improve the efficiency and quality of clinical research.
Working closely with patient advocacy groups, healthcare providers and the European Union, Data Lake will be the first in the world to create an ethical, consent-based medical data donation program.” The team behind Data Lake includes medical doctors and individuals from the MedTech field, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain worlds.
Data Lake is building a global medical data donation system based on blockchain technology powered by the $LAKE token.</p>
