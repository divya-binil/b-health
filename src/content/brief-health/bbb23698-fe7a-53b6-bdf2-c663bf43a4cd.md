<p>Some advocates argue that telehealth can help increase access to healthcare and improve health equity.
At the 2021 UN Climate Conference, Cop26, in Glasgow, Scotland, hospitals and health systems acknowledged the role they have to play in mitigating the effects of climate change.
Hospitals and health systems shed light on the health-related effects of climate change, such as illness and disease from events like wildfires and extreme weather.
Health systems are also becoming more aware of their own contributions to climate change, with the U.S. healthcare system emitting 27 percent of healthcare emissions worldwide.</p>
