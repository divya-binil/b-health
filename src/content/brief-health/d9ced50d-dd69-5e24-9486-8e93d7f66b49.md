Aug. 25, 2022Artificial intelligence startup DataRobot interim CEO Debanjan Saha announced the Boston-based company’s second round of job cuts since May in a move “to adapt to changing market dynamics,” and even though the company did not specify the number of employees leaving, LinkedIn reported it will affect 26% of its staff, which, according to the site TechTarget, would mean roughly 260 of its 1,000 employees.
</p><p>Aug. 25, 2022Tennessee-based trucking company U.S. Xpress cut 5% of its corporate workforce, a spokesperson confirmed to local ABC affiliate WTVC, bringing its total layoffs this summer to roughly 140, following a round of cuts in May that slashed another 5% of the company’s corporate staff, reported at the time to be around 70 employees.
Aug. 16, 2022Philadelphia-based Audacy, the second biggest radio company in the United States, cut 5% of its workforce (estimated to be roughly 250 employees), Inside Radio reported, with CEO David Field saying the cuts come “in light of current macroeconomic headwinds.”
Aug. 15, 2022HBO Max cut 70 jobs (14% of its workforce) in a cost-cutting effort that comes four months after Discovery’s $43 billion acquisition of HBO Max parent company WarnerMedia, and a week after the company announced plans to combine the streaming service with Discovery+ as soon as next year, Deadline reported.
</p><p>Aug. 12, 2022Peloton, which gained popularity as gyms shut their doors during the pandemic, announced a sweeping round of layoffs in a memo to employees obtained by Bloomberg, six months after the New York-based company cut 2,800 jobs.
Aug. 10, 2022Microsoft reportedly laid off 200 employees, less than a month after the Redmond, Wash.-based tech giant announced it would cut 1% of its 180,000 workers, Business Insider reported, with the cuts coming in the company’s modern life experiences team.
Aug. 9, 2022Canadian social media management company Hootsuite reportedly announced plans to cut 30% of its estimated 1,000 employees.

</p><p>Aug. 1, 2022Texas-based data technology giant Oracle started laying off an undisclosed number of its estimated 143,000 employees, as part of a larger plan to cut thousands, The Information reported, citing an unnamed source (rumors of job cuts at Oracle have been speculated for nearly a month).
July 26, 2022E-commerce company Shopify became the latest company to lay off employees, cutting ties with 1,000 (10% of its workforce), CEO Tobi Lutke announced, saying skyrocketing demand for online shopping during the pandemic has leveled off, and that the company made a bet that “didn’t pay off.”
July 12, 2022Tesla laid off 229 employees, primarily in its autopilot division, and shut down its San Mateo, California, office, just weeks after CEO Elon Musk sent an email to executives, saying he had a “super bad feeling” about the economy and planned to cut 10% of his workforce, Reuters reported.
July 12, 2022California-based mortgage lender loanDepot announced plans to lay off 2,000 workers by the end of the year, bringing its 2022 layoffs to 4,800 — more than half of the company’s 8,500 employees as the housing market “contracted sharply and abruptly,” CEO Frank Martell said in a statement.</p>
