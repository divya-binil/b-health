<p>A consortium led by T-Systems and Better will implement Better Meds, the renowned electronic prescription and medication administration (EPMA) system built on the open EHR standard, across more than 60 hospitals in Catalonia. With the establishment of its vendor-neutral health data platform and medication management system, which will eventually be accessible throughout the entirety of Catalonia, Catalan Health Service's (CatSalut) ambition to provide integrated care via a patient and data-centric longitudinal electronic health record will move one step closer. "By providing a common health data specification, based on open EHR, managing electronic health records and other healthcare data will be much easier and more efficient," stated Dr. Jordi Piera Jim√©nez, Director of the Digital Health Strategy Office at CatSalut.</p>
