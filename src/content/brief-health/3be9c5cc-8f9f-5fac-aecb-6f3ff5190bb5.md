<p>Project Ronin, which focuses on cancer care via RPM, shows how artificial intelligence, natural language processing and EHRs come together to aid physicians.
Ronin uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing and electronic health records in its work to manage cancer patients.
Healthcare IT News sat down with Hastings to discuss how Ronin's RPM for cancer patients works, the roles of AI and NLP in the RPM, and how EHRs play an important part in this type of care delivery. Healthcare generally moves a little slower, but you're now starting to see artificial intelligence, mainly machine learning and natural language processing capabilities, to not necessarily advise a clinician what they might or should do, but be able to bring insights out of the data they're capturing on patients.
</p><p>For example, we see patients who have different demographics, lab values, medication regimens, along with different reported symptoms, and now we can create models that look across those many factors and provide the physician with insights.
This patient is like this other cohort of patients who have ended up in the emergency room and so now we can provide the physician insights using artificial intelligence to aid them in the care of the patient by giving them some predictive capabilities they could find on their own, but the amount of time and data they would have to dig through to be able to do that is unreasonable in their day-to-day job.
EHRs are embracing third-party, value-added capabilities being embedded right in the EHR, right next to the workflow that the physician is used to, and that's really opened up a lot of capabilities and really enabled bringing AI in the forms of machine learning and natural language processing directly into the hands of the physician.</p>
