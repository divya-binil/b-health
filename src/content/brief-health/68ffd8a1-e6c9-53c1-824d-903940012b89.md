<p>Many are wondering if VBC will be the next revolution in healthcare. Value-based care (VBC) has gained popularity as a catchphrase, capturing much of the media's focus on "the future of healthcare." VBC is seeking investments from numerous start-ups, big healthcare payor organisations, provider groupings, hospital systems, and even technology firms. The phrase "value-based care" (VBC) is used to refer specifically to a model of care delivery that places more emphasis on the patient's quality and "value" of care than on its quantity. It is described as "a healthcare delivery paradigm in which providers, including hospitals and physicians, are compensated based on patient health outcomes" in an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Value-based care agreements compensate providers for assisting patients in enhancing their health.</p>
