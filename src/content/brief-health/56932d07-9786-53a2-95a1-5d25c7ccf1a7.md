<p>Five years ago, in his then-capacity as president and chief executive officer of Geisinger, Dr. David Feinberg keynoted Day 4 of the 2016 annual Cerner Health Conference.
"In the five years since I last talked at CHC, there have been some amazing medical breakthroughs," said Feinberg in his virtual keynote address.
But still, said Feinberg, "the noise remains.
He explained: "It's the noise in the healthcare system that will drag you down, she said.
Feinberg added another example: "It's having me – an MD, an MBA with decades of experience as a doctor and running hospitals – yet not being able to make sense of an explanation of benefits of my healthcare, from my own health system.
Health IT has enabled a lot of major progress in recent years, he said, but there's still a lot of heavy lifting to do.
He pointed to Banner Health's work with Cerner to improve intake forms and other administrative burdens, "so their nurses can spend more time helping patients and less time documenting.
"If we use your records to improve your health, it can also improve the health of your communities – and ultimately our world."</p>
