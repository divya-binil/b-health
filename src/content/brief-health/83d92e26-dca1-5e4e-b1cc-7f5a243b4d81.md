      More than 1.2 billion clinical documents are generated each year in the
      U.S., but there is very little analysis of that unstructured information.
      The Apixio Platform can mine textual data and combine its generated
      insights with available structured data to craft computable individual
      health profiles, or phenotypes. We analyze our assembled phenotypes in
      real-time using a flexible rules engine. This automates the execution of
      clinical guidelines, quality and risk measures, payment or reimbursement
      policies, and other operational and administrative rules, to support
      critical healthcare activities.
