<p>Population health and precision medicine have often been set against each other because of the inherent differences in their approaches to health management, but the COVID-19 pandemic has shone a bright light on both, highlighting some potential intersections that may not have been so apparent in the past.</p><p>Population health is about the health of a population, aggregating data from thousands or even millions of people to provide a generic direction. Precision medicine is about you, the individual, how you react to certain medications, your genetic code and a host of other personal data points. On the surface, healthcare analytics sounds like an overarching solution in both domains, because you are collecting data on the populations and individuals to propose courses of action.</p>
