<p>Any surgical operation has some risk for the patient. However, there is stress on the surgical team as well because they must follow precise standards and procedures to guarantee successful, safe patient surgeries. One concern is the possibility of unintentionally igniting the surgical table drapes or burning a patient or member of the operating room team. Burns from the heat produced by the fibre optic light cables that illuminate endoscopes and camera cables that surgeons use during operations to see what's happening internally might occur, however this is unusual. A tool to lessen that risk has been created by James Rains, a professor in Georgia Tech's Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering. Jackson Medical, a 2016 startup in Atlanta that manufactures medical devices, has Rains as co-founder and CEO.&nbsp;</p><p>Physician burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It is a common problem among healthcare professionals, particularly among those who work in high-stress environments or have demanding work schedules. Symptoms of burnout may include feelings of exhaustion, cynicism, and a lack of accomplishment, as well as a decrease in work productivity. Burnout can have serious consequences for both the individual experiencing it and for the quality of care they are able to provide to their patients. It is important for healthcare professionals to be aware of the signs of burnout and to take steps to prevent or address it. This may involve finding ways to manage stress, seeking support from colleagues and mentors, and taking time off when needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
