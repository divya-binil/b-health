Sadly, there was a serious threat at the beginning of the year. Russian cyberattacks may be used as a form of retaliation in response to the economic and military sanctions the U.S. government and NATO allies have imposed on the country, according to a cybersecurity advice released by the American Hospital Association (AHA) on February 23.
