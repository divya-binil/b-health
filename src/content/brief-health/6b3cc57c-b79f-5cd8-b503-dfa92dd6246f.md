A HIPAA-compliant teledentistry platform is essential for regulatory compliance and dental risk management. So, in a world of boundless technology options, how do you even begin to research, select, and successfully implement a HIPAA-compliant teledentistry solution in your practice? When it comes to selecting a teledentistry platform, narrow your search to include only dental-specific solutions. From there, include only established HIPAA-compliant teledentistry platforms that meet the specific regulatory needs of a dental practice versus a business-oriented program that may or may not provide a business associate agreement or be fully HIPAA compliant. Insisting that all teledentistry platforms under consideration be HIPAA compliant ensures two key things: HIPAA-compliant vendors must follow the provisions of the security rule just like a dental practice.

Many of the programs that the Office of Civil Rights mentioned in its March 2020 Bulletin are general industry platforms that pivoted during the peak of the crisis to meet health-care needs. Yet dental practices have unique needs, such as the need to communicate confidentially and share patient information securely with referring or specialist dentists. If a teledentistry solution is an offshoot of a telemedicine platform, it was not specifically developed for dentistry, and as such, may not integrate with your practice management software. If so, perhaps itâ€™s time to consider a HIPAA-compliant teledentistry platform.
