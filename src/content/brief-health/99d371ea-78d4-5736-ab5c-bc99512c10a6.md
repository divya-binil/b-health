<p>Ajayi discusses the challenges Medicaid and other underserved patients face when accessing the healthcare system – and how the startup approaches expansion into new markets. According to Dr. Toyin Ajayi, CEO and cofounder of Cityblock Health, Medicaid and other marginalised patients are regularly left in the dark by the current healthcare system. Due to transportation problems or the requirement to take time off work, they could only have rare access to the medical system. It's possible that doctors' offices are busy and don't have enough time to handle issues. While this is going on, patients who identify as LGBT or members of racial or ethnic minorities more frequently report experiencing prejudice or disdain, which drives them away from healthcare professionals. As a result, when a patient's health situation worsens, they end up in the emergency room. Ajayi explained that Cityblock's value-based care strategy, which incorporates primary care, mental healthcare, and assistance with addressing social issues, encourages them to identify patients who need support and choose how to address those needs.</p>
