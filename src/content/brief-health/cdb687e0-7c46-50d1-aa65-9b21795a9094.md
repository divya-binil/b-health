<p>A three-time survey of 1,300 physicians from 2016-2022 revealed growing recognition of technology's benefit, with the biggest growth seen in remote care tools and planning for digital therapeutics.<br><br>The average number of digital health tools in use by a physician grew from 2.2 in 2016 to 3.8 in 2022, with the largest growth in remote care tools.
"The physician adoption rate of digital health tools has accelerated as physicians grow increasingly optimistic about the advantages that properly designed digital health tools can have for patient care, if key requirements are met," said Resneck.</p>
