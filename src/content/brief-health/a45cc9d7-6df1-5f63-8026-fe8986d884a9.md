Facial recognition technology is upon us. It has great merits but can also be used in a number of scary ways hurting our privacy. Facial recognition technology is here; it can be used to unlock phones and computers using your unique facial structure, but it can also unnervingly be used to identify you through surveillance cameras, which are frighteningly becoming more commonplace. In fact, Australian governments have been actively promoting the adoption of this technology using what The Guardian refers to as &quot;creative justifications&quot; including public transportation fees and government refunds. What about this technology&#39;s effects on healthcare, though?

Will it revolutionise the healthcare system or portend a future worthy of Black Mirror, from improved diagnosis of rare ailments to racial discrimination? In this post, we&#39;ll examine these issues and others as we walk you through the fundamentals of this popular technology. 

Facial recognition technology has a number of potential uses in medicine and healthcare, including:

*   Patient identification: Facial recognition technology can be used to quickly and accurately identify patients, which can help to reduce errors and improve efficiency in healthcare settings.
*   Monitoring patients: Facial recognition technology can be used to monitor patients&#39; vital signs, such as heart rate and body temperature, and alert medical staff if there are any signs of distress.
*   Disease diagnosis: Facial recognition technology can be used to identify specific diseases based on changes in a person&#39;s facial features. For example, researchers have used facial recognition technology to automatically detect signs of diabetic retinopathy, a disease that can cause blindness.
*   Mental health diagnosis: Facial recognition technology can be used to identify signs of mental health disorders such as depression or anxiety, by analyzing changes in facial expressions.
*   Robotic surgery: Facial recognition technology can be used in robotic surgery to control the movement of the robot based on the position and orientation of the patient&#39;s face.
*   It&#39;s worth noting that most of the above potential use cases are still in research and development phase, and not widely used in the clinical practice yet.
