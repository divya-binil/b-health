<p>Effective leadership in the healthcare industry is reliant on the development of admiration and respect for your team to enable trust. The best astronauts are known to be chosen for space missions, and they go through rigorous training to prepare them for the responsibilities that come with entering space. The same applies to healthcare. Every day, healthcare professionals like doctors, nurses, and other staff members are responsible for patients, some of whom are in life-or-death situations. As we operate in high-risk, high-intensity environments, Mike Massimino, a retired NASA astronaut, shares his insights on effective leadership. He also discusses what healthcare leaders can do to ensure they are leading effectively. Contrary to popular belief, there are more parallels between space and healthcare. At NASA, one of them is that we prioritise working as a team.</p>
