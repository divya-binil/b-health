<p>It is a startup that offers health checkups and clean products to women.
Rajpreet Kaur founded Say Cheese as a holistic wellness platform for women.
The brand offers women a platform to become life coaches, wellness coaches, counselors, etc.
It also offers women to share their stories and seek help.
Say Cheese is where women get financial, relationship and health assistance to identify the root cause of their problems and work towards building a happy life. Achitha Jacob is the founder of Proactive For Her, a healthcare startup that helps women deal with clinical issues related to sexual health, PCOS, hair, skin and other issues.
In an interview with Business Standard, she was quoted saying, “We believe all women should have access to the best medical experts, who have a patient-centric, liberal and empathetic approach towards women’s health issues.”
The experts on the platform treat a spectrum of women and offer them personalised solutions.
Evelyn Immanuel started Ava in 2019 intending to provide women solutions for menstrual health issues, mental health queries and more.</p>
