<p>"2021 has seen increased interest by governments and health and care organizations globally for implementing the IPS to enhance timely cross-border health information flow and interoperability," said Alex Elias, chair of SNOMED International’s General Assembly, in a statement.
"This has been a primary driver in SNOMED International supporting this recent initiative to make the IPS sub-ontology openly available with SNOMED CT content," Elias continued.
"Equipping the IPS, already one of the best examples of international collaboration among standards bodies, with the full capability of SNOMED CT’s ontological design is a significant action that we can contribute to achieving health information access gains for patients," he added.</p>
