      Our three founders came together with a passion to fundamentally change
      the trajectory of healthcare by leveraging a clinical model that would
      anchor around primary care physicians, giving them the tools and resources
      needed to fulfill their Hippocratic oath to care for patients to the best
      of their ability.


      To continue growing our vision, we leveraged our extensive clinical
      experience, tapped into our healthcare leader community, and surrounded
      ourselves with outstanding partners, advisors and investors. Together, we
      have continued to grow VillageMD, and through our subsidiary Village
      Medical, we have become one of the leading, national providers of
      value-based primary care services.


      The Village Medical brand provides primary care for patients at
      traditional free-standing clinics, Village Medical at Walgreens co-located
      clinics, as well as extended access via primary care in the home and
      virtual visits through a proprietary technology solution. Our passion
      continues, our ambitions are endless as we continue to transform
      healthcare.
