<p>Greater Baltimore Medical Center (GMBC) HealthCare, a Towson, Md.-based health system, <a href="https://www.gbmc.org/computer-network-incident-update-12-06-2020">announced last week that</a> it has begun to restore the organization’s electronic medical record (EMR) system after it was taken offline following a December ransomware attack.</p><p>On Dec. 6, GBMC HealthCare detected a cyber incident that impacted its information technology (IT) systems. While the organization itself didn’t release many details about the attack, according to a <a href="https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2020/12/18/gbmc-ransomware-cyberattack-nurse-speaks-latest/">December report</a> from CBS Baltimore, a nurse at the health system told the media outlet that the two weeks following the cybersecurity incident has already set the organization back decades. “Everything is on paper documentation,” the nurse said to the outlet, on the condition of anonymity. She added, per that report, “The fax machine just started printing out hundreds of pages, just saying, ‘you’re being attacked, you’re being attacked, you’re being attacked.’”</p>
