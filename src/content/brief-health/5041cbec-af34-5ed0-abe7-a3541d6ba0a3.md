<p>Mental health chatbot Woebot Health brings on Moses Ike as the company's first chief financial officer, and digital neurotherapeutic maker MindMaze announces a slew of new leadership hires. Digital musculoskeletal care company Hinge Health has hired Mario Queiroz as chief product officer.
Ike most recently worked at worker injury-focused healthcare company Paradigm Corporation, where he was vice president and head of M&amp;A and corporate development.
"As we scale our company and expand our commercial operations, we needed a leader with proven experience in developing and maturing healthcare organizations," CEO Michael Evers said in a statement.
She previously served as U.S. chief commercial officer at London-based hospital-at-home and decentralized clinical-trial company Huma.
Sue Olsen was appointed senior vice president and general manager for the U.S. She joins MindMaze from Quality Rehab Management, where she worked as chief innovation officer.</p>
