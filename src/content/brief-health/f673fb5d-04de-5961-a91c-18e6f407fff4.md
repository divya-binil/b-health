<p>The Australasian Institute of Digital Health has opened applications for its new leadership programme to advance women's careers in digital health.
According to a press statement, the six-month Women in Digital Health Leadership programme aims to enable women to "realise and develop their leadership potential to advance the capability of organisations to achieve 'healthier lives, digitally-enabled'".
"Women are the majority of the workforce but do not hold an equitable share of healthcare leadership positions," the organisation said, adding that without gender diversity, the country's healthcare industry "will continue to perpetuate an inequitable health system".</p>
