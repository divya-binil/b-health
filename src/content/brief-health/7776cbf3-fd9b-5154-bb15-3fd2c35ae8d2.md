"Besides decreased time under anesthesia, we are finding that our patients have less pain during their recovery process and are left with smaller incisions."<br><br><a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/digital-health/new-jersey-hospital-using-digital-platform-to-increase-surgery-efficiency.html">Read on beckershospitalreview.com</a></p>
