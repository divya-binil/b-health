<p>In 2021, the digital health industry saw an influx of funding, surpassing 2020’s full-year total after the second quarter.
Will digital health funding continue at the same rapid pace in 2022?
MobiHealthNews asked digital health leaders and executives their predictions about funding for next year.
"That means investors will start flowing more capital to digital health leaders so they have the resources to acquire others that complement their platforms, building more complete solutions.”
One of the areas where I expect a lot of investment to flow is to digital health companies that smartly address health equity and deliver better care for vulnerable populations.”
"Digital health companies that deliver value outcomes and keep the patient experience top of mind will play an important role in strengthening our healthcare infrastructure for everyone.”</p>
