<p>Some of the hurdles around vaccine distribution could be addressed with high-tech solutions, particularly where environmental management is concerned.<br><br>As health systems begin to roll out COVID-19 vaccines, much attention has been paid to the "cold chain,"&nbsp;the organizations and equipment that enable their necessary sub-zero storage and transport.</p><p>Experts have pointed to the clear logistical and <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hackers-taking-aim-crucial-covid-19-vaccine-cold-chain-says-ibm">security</a> <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/vaccine-distribution-pipeline-faces-serious-cybersecurity-risks">challenges</a> this unique supply chain presents. But others say that some of these hurdles around vaccine distribution could be addressed with technology â€“ particularly where humidity and temperature controls are concerned.</p><p>Paul Daniel, senior regulatory compliance expert at Vaisala Oyj, which develops and markets environmental and industrial measurement services, concedes that the world of&nbsp;temp control monitoring "is not sexy."&nbsp;That said, "it's really critical."</p><p>As Daniel explained, it's not quite accurate to think of controlling the ambient temperature around the vaccine as <i>complicating</i> the process. Rather, he said, the temperature control <i>is</i> the process.</p>
