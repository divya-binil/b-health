<p>Under-researched female health problems have incredible societal costs. Not only on the labour market, but also in other areas.&nbsp;<br><br>But there is a long list of diseases and conditions that have a significantly higher prevalence among one of the sexes, like liver cancer or tuberculosis occurring more often in the male population, and autoimmune diseases or multiple sclerosis among the females.
The interesting thing is, that figures suggest that although roughly half the population is female pretty much all across the globe, research on female-dominant diseases is underfunded, while male-dominant ones are overfunded.
Endometriosis, Alzheimerâ€™s, Crohn disease, rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune conditions are just a few of the diseases that are affecting women significantly more and receive only a moderate amount of research funding.
Females were not included in clinical trials before 1993, not even in mice
The fact that women generally experience significantly more side effects from various drugs is not surprising after knowing how they were not included in clinical trials for quite a long time.</p>
