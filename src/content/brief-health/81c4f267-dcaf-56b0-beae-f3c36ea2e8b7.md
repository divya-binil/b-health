    <p>Digital health can be advantageous for all professionals. However,
    nursing professionals are able to see and feel the benefits in their
    everyday work, and in how they go about performing their roles and duties.
    If digital health is not fully embraced, the nursing sector may find that
    standards fall behind other healthcare sectors and professions.
