<p>Technological innovations can help us track what’s in our food and what we should eat based on our genetic background.
In this article, we enlisted the top trends concerning eating and food tracking.
Almost 700 million people have some health problem with food or eating
The last time we checked, researchers estimated that up to 15 million Americans have food allergies – that was in 2017.
As of today this number almost doubled: currently it is estimated that 32 million Americans have food allergies of some sort, including 5.6 million children under age 18.
And, according to the FAO, the UN body that leads international efforts to defeat hunger and improve nutrition and food security, healthy diets are out of reach for 3 billion people around the world.
