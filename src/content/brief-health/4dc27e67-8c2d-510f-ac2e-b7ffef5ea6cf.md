<p>Here is a roundup of some of the best medical apps we loved and found useful during the COVID-19 pandemic over the past year — in no particular order.</p><p>Happy downloading and stay safe!</p><p><a href="https://www.imedicalapps.com/2020/07/covid-protocols-app-review/"><strong>COVID Protocols: The Brigham Hospital’s Approach to COVID</strong></a></p><p>The Brigham and Women’s Hospital released a comprehensive app of all of their COVID-19 protocols. This app joins a growing list of guidelines and protocols from Johns Hopkins (via the Relief Central and Hopkins Abx Guide apps), WHO, Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and others.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.imedicalapps.com/2020/07/mydirectives-mobile-app/"><strong>MyDirectives MOBILE App: Create and Bring Advanced Directives Anywhere&nbsp;</strong></a></p><p>MyDirectives.com first launched their companion app for iOS in 2015. Their website and app can be used separately, but ideally, they should be together. The website discusses the goals of “create, update, and share.” The app allows the user to digitally sign the plan, make a video of your wishes, use photos and videos to confirm your identity, share the Advance Care plan with others via email, text, QR reader, and show on the iPhone lock screen!</p>
