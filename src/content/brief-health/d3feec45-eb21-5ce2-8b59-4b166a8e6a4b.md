<p><strong>Consumerism was on the rise prior to the pandemic as we looked for ways to make our daily interactions more convenient and efficient in a tumultuous time.</strong></p><p>We quickly adjusted our lives in response to COVID-19, amplifying this consumerism trend. Customer expectations changed, and COVID-19 forced companies of all kinds to innovate at an accelerated rate to make experiences as self-service and user-friendly as possible. Seemingly overnight, real time communication, digital interactions and tracking of everything from retail purchases to pizzas became the norm. Now, consumerism has taken over every facet of our lives, regardless of our generation. It is the rule rather than the exception.</p><p><strong>During this time, the healthcare industry made rapid strides to innovate in response to changed market conditions and member and patient needs and expectations. Regardless of what happens next in our “new normal”, this evolution needs to continue</strong>, and center more and more around implementing experience automation powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) to increase member and patient satisfaction, relieve staff burden and power more self-service.</p><p><strong>This E-book guide explains how healthcare companies can easily adopt or adapt automation of customer experiences to elevate customer satisfaction, reduce staff burdens, and reduce operating expenses by enabling customer self-service and automating predictable customer touchpoints and journeys.</strong></p>
