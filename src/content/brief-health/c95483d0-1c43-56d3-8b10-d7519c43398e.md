<p>LeanTaaS introduces an AI autopilot for its iQueue operations platforms, Carbon Health introduces AI charting in its EHR, and Clarify Health makes Clara, its AI copilot, available to a limited number of healthcare organisations. It's difficult to predict where the groundswell on generative AI tools in healthcare is heading given that healthcare technology innovation is driven to integrate artificial intelligence into a variety of healthcare systems to improve costs, patient outcomes, and employee experiences. Brent Lamm, CIO at UNC Health, based in Morrisville, North Carolina, said, "Given the nature of this technology and the significant resources required to make it work, I expect most organisations will need to align with strategic partners." Lamm recently spoke with Epic and Microsoft about his work testing and piloting the application of AI in clinical settings and business operations. In his words to Healthcare IT News, "ensuring alignment of values is just as important, if not more so, than alignment of technology and architecture."</p>
