<p>Tool uses natural language processing to cull unstructured information in combination with structured data from a patient’s electronic health record. An artificial intelligence tool that researchers at the Regenstrief Institute, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), and the medical schools of Indiana University and the University of Miami developed for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in primary care is currently being evaluated in real-world settings. The passive digital marker is an algorithm that the researchers created, trained, and tested for use in the Digital Detection of Dementia study. The programme extracts structured and unstructured data from a patient's electronic health record using natural language processing. These can include references to memory problems, warnings about vascular issues, concomitant diseases, or other elements that could be associated with dementia.</p>
