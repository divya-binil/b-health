<p>Like countless other industries, healthcare has historically been led and run by men. As a result,&nbsp;there has been, and still is, a damaging level of female under-representation in both scientific studies and health datasets. This has led to poorer outcomes for women and low awareness and support of female-specific health issues across the board.&nbsp;</p><p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bma.org.uk/media/2116/bma-womens-health-inequalities-report-aug-2018.pdf">study</a>&nbsp;from the BMA showed that women spend less of their lives in good health (free from long-term illness or disability) compared to men, even though they have a higher life expectancy.</p><p>This gender inequality leads to great risks, as we generalise symptoms according to data which was not designed to highlight differences in presentation - for example in heart attacks, where female symptoms vary from those displayed by men - something researchers only discovered in the last decade.&nbsp;This both reflects and exacerbates the gender inequalities we witness across society and, when it comes to healthcare, clearly has potentially life-threatening repercussions.&nbsp;</p>
