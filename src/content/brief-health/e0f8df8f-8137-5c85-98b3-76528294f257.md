<p>The&nbsp;Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation&nbsp;is simplifying the distribution of addiction treatment and recovery support content with the&nbsp;Oracle Cerner&nbsp;electronic health record (EHR) and&nbsp;Xealth’s&nbsp;digital therapeutic distribution platform. The new system makes it easier for Hazelden Betty Ford clinicians to personalize care for their patients by assigning them digital content, including therapeutic education, exercises, and workshops, accessible via the EHR’s patient portal. The new central repository for patients will be accessible during in-person or online treatment and at later touchpoints throughout their long-term recovery process. Hazelden Betty Ford, a longtime Oracle Cerner client, is the nation’s largest nonprofit system of addiction treatment, mental health care, recovery resources and related prevention and education services.</p>
