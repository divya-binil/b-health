<p>The telehealth and RPM use cases the Colorado health system had been prioritizing prior to the pandemic shifted gears when it was forced to fast-track many of its initiatives in a more controlled approach.<br><br>Aurora, Colorado-based UCHealth created its Virtual Health Center, which provided a virtual urgent care system, Safety View virtual sitter program and virtual ICU system, and centralized-telemetry monitoring services.
Further, the health system was beginning to develop technologies to remotely monitor patients at home, specifically for diabetes care.
"On the ambulatory front, we had created a solution for home telehealth visits, had a robust tele-stroke and mobile stroke program, and offered a small virtual specialty outreach program," said Kathy Deanda, senior director of virtual health at UCHealth.</p>
