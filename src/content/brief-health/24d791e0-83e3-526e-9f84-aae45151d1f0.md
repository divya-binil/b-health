<p>Over the past year, several lockdowns have taken place. We adopted new habits, learned and worked through videoconferences, made social distancing an everyday habit, and masks a fashion item. But we all hate these, don’t we? So once we have a chance to end the pandemic, I’d say we should go for it, and with several trustworthy and reviewed vaccines available worldwide, the race for vaccination has begun.&nbsp;</p><p>And once the vaccination brings down case numbers, patients with chronic illnesses will return to the system and meet a totally burned out, exhausted personnel.</p><p>Moreover, with so much time spent online, we now have multiple generations glued to the screens and sometimes unknowingly spreading misinformation limitlessly. In this regard, the next task will be how to combat fake news, fight anti-vaxxers and gain our lives back again.</p>
