title: 'The Future of Emergency Medicine: 6 Technologies That Make Patients The Point-of-Care'

We strongly believe that only digital health can bring healthcare into the 21st century and make patients the point-of-care.

Car crashes, home injuries, fires, natural disasters: every minute – if not every second – spent without treatment in such cases of medical emergencies and high-risk patients could reduce the chance of survival or proper recovery. In fact, when deprived of oxygen, permanent brain damage begins after only 4 minutes, while death can occur as soon as 4-6 minutes later. In this race against time, digital health technologies that turn patients into the point-of-care could prove to be game-changers for first responders and emergency units. 

From driverless cars through medical drones to artificial intelligence (A.I.), advanced technologies are enhancing the field of emergency medicine. It’s helpful to have a better look at how those technologies are influencing emergency care and what lies ahead.
