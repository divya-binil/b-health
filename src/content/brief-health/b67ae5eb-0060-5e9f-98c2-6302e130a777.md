<p>Patient medical records have long been viewed as inflexible, difficult to use, archaic and costly to configure.1&nbsp;However, these records are critical to improving the patient experience throughout their care journey. They provide healthcare professionals with the information needed to help make good clinical decisions and evaluate care management plans across the entire continuum of care.&nbsp;Other benefits include ensuring accuracy and timeliness of payment for services performed, and helping to mitigate malpractice risks.2&nbsp;</p>
