<p>A virtual ward provides the same data real time as would be available if the patient was hospitalised, while he actually stays at home with the family.<br><br>“A virtual ward is a solution that supports patients who would otherwise be in hospital to get the acute care, remote monitoring and treatment in their own homes, with the use of digital, remote monitoring health tools relaying real-time data to the hospital.
The main difference between ‘full-grown’ virtual wards and the earlier existing solutions is the available data.
Virtual wards provide the same data real-time as would be available if the patient was hospitalised.”
The data is displayed in real-time in the hospital, and the support staff follows it as closely as if the patient was monitored in the intensive care unit.
The patient has the option to immediately contact the health team, and real-time data allows healthcare providers to immediately intervene if measurements suggest deterioration in the patient’s condition.</p>
