    description: >-
      At CloudMedx, we collect and convert disparate healthcare data into a
      holistic, actionable view of the individual. Our aligned approach is based
      on integrating with existing systems, becoming an intuitive extension of
      the way providers, payers, and even patients collaborate.


      CloudMedx's mission was born out of the near-death experience of the
      founder's father as a result of a misdiagnosis. This was ultimately a
      symptom of an overrun system that does not function as well as it could.
      In order to deliver better, more accurate care, we decided to take an
      aligned approach; to unite healthcare across the continuum and benefit
      both patients, payers, and doctors.


      By using data as our superpower instead of an obstacle, together we can
      fundamentally change the future of healthcare.

<p>June 7, 2022</p><p><i>2022 Cohort Includes Medical Device, Diagnostics and Digital Health Startups From Across the Globe Developing Innovative Technologies to Improve Patient Care and Outcomes</i></p><p>LOS ANGELES–(BUSINESS WIRE)–MedTech Innovator, the world’s largest accelerator of medical technology companies, today announced the 50 companies selected to participate in the organization’s flagship four-month Accelerator program, featuring medical device, diagnostic, and digital health technologies from around the globe. As 2022 Cohort members, these startups will get unparalleled visibility and access to leading MedTech manufacturers, providers, investors, and other industry stakeholders. At the conclusion of the program, MedTech Innovator will award $500,000 in cash and in-kind prizes in the final competition held at The MedTech Conference, powered by AdvaMed in Boston this fall.</p><p>“Over the past nine years, MedTech Innovator has established a unique track record of identifying and supporting leading startups, with 95% of our graduates either still in business or having been acquired,” said Paul Grand, CEO of MedTech Innovator. “The 2022 MedTech Innovator Cohort represents a diverse and focused group of innovators, and we are excited to work with them alongside our corporate partners and industry advisors to ensure their success in addressing important unmet needs and improving patient care.”</p><p>The tenth annual program launches June 15-16, at the invite only MedTech Innovator Summit in Mountain View, California. Leadership teams from each of the 50 startups will convene to attend networking events and workshops with MedTech Innovator Partners and other industry leaders. The 2022 Cohort will also be featured June 17 at the WSGR Medical Device Conference in San Francisco.</p><p>As in previous years, the selection process for the 2022 Accelerator program was extremely competitive, with a 5% acceptance rate. The top 50 were selected from a record pool of more than 1,000 applications representing 49 countries and 43 U.S. States. From that group, MedTech Innovator with its corporate partners and over 400 industry judges, evaluated pitches from 170 candidates to select this year’s cohort of 50 startups representing 10 U.S. states as well as Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Ireland, Luxembourg, Singapore, and the UK.</p><p>A subset of 28 early-stage companies will participate in MedTech Innovator’s corporate mentorship program, in which MEDtech startups are matched with senior industry leaders to receive continual in-depth, customized mentorship and support.</p><p>The program culminates at The MedTech Conference, powered by AdvaMed, on October 24-26, where all 50 companies will present in Showcase panels and gain access to industry and investor partnering opportunities. During the conference, five startups from the Accelerator cohort will compete for the Execution Award, and another five companies will advance to compete in the Grand Final competition. An audience vote will determine the winner of the $350,000 non-dilutive grand prize and the title of 2022 MedTech Innovator.
