<p>GE Healthcare <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220316005427/en/GE-Healthcare-AliveCor-Partnership-Aims-to-Increase-Convenience-for-Patients-and-Help-Reduce-Cardiac-Related-Hospitalizations-by-Improving-the-Quality-and-Integration-of-Patient-Data">partnered</a> with AliveCor to integrate real-time data from personal electrocardiogram devices directly into hospital workflows.</p><p>Data from AliveCor's KardiaMobile 6L ECG, a portable ECG device that can detect AFib and other heart rhythm conditions, is viewable on a smart phone and sent to GE Healthcare's MUSE cardiac management system, which allows physicians to view and evaluate the results in an EHR, according to a March 16 press release.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To enroll, physicians can prescribe patients with certain cardiac diagnoses, to KardiaMobile 6L. This will link patients to a clinical desktop where they can access KardiaMobile 6L to record ECG that will be automatically transferred from AliveCor's cloud server directly into MUSE.</p><p>The aim of the partnership is to improve patient outcomes and reduce the number of cardiac-related hospitalizations.</p>
