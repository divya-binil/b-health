<p>Although it may seem counterintuitive, telemedicine can act as a bridge between vulnerable pregnant people and their providers.<br><br>This past week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a trove of data suggesting that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6944e3.htm?s_cid=mm6944e3_w">pregnant patients</a> might be at increased risk for severe illness associated with COVID-19.</p><p>In light of the statistics, CDC advised that measures to prevent coronavirus infection should be emphasized for pregnant people and their families. Telehealth and virtual care, with its natural distancing, could be one such measure.</p><p>Although it may seem counterintuitive, given the hands-on approach obstetricians and gynecologists often take with care, telemedicine can act as a bridge between vulnerable pregnant people and their providers without requiring as much in-person exposure.</p>
