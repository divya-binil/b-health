title: Interoperability can cut health costs by $30B. But this needs to happen first
---

Regulatory requirements are only one component on the road to achieving the interoperability goals of coordinated and patient-centered care. To make these cost savings a reality and happen effectively, healthcare providers, payers, and third-party app developers need to step up. With a surge in patients at hospitals and emergency rooms, providers and support staff are constantly under stress with limited time to gather patient health information. Interoperability would enable providers to quickly and seamlessly access a patient’s medical record either through their electronic health record (EHR) or directly from the patient’s phone. 

Interoperability is meant to streamline care, promote patient-centered care, and is also an opportunity to reduce healthcare costs by an estimated $30 billion.
