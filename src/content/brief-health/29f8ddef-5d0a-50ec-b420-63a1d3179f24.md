<p>Prior to COVID-19, medical errors were the third-leading cause of death in the United States, after heart disease and cancer. A coalition of healthcare organizations and experts is calling for the creation of an independent federal agency, the <a href="https://npsb.org/">National Patient Safety Board</a> (NPSB), that would be modeled in part on the National Transportation Safety Board.</p><p>The NPSB would improve and promote public health and welfare by monitoring and anticipating adverse events, creating recommendations and solutions to prevent medical error, and bringing lessons into practice.</p>
