title: Social determinants of health program Gravity Project joins HL7 FHIR accelerator
---

The HL7 FHIR Accelerator Program's new Gravity Project aims to standardize medical codes for social determinants of health, develop methods for capturing SDOH in health records and create FHIR guidelines for the data. Research has shown that health outcomes depend more on factors such as housing, income, social support and public safety than on medical care, and health insurers are beginning to offer coverage of nonmedical care that improves SDOH.
