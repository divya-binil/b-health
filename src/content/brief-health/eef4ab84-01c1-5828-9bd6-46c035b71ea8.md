<p>In our new series, Emerging Trends, we are looking at those technologies in digital health that are on a certain ‘hype cycle’ – technologies and solutions that currently stand out from the rest because of their novelty, timeliness, or greatness. These are solutions everyone’s talking about or the ones they <i>should</i>. We are beginning with skin checking algorithms, which is definitely a course currently rising. Let’s have a deeper look.</p><p>Everyone should have a skin check done from time to time. Skin cancer is one of the most common cancer types worldwide: <a href="https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/skin-cancer-facts/#:~:text=1%20in%205%20Americans%20will,doubles%20your%20risk%20for%20melanoma.">one in five</a> people in the U.S. is expected to receive a skin cancer diagnosis during their lifetime. Early detection and treatment are invaluable: almost all skin cancers (both melanoma and nonmelanoma) <a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2021/cancer-facts-and-figures-2021.pdf">can be cured</a> if found and treated early. Prevention and detection are the key.</p>
