<p>The former president of the American Medical Association says that development requires clear-eyed conversations about the potential consequences of technology.<br><br>There's no question that the COVID-19 pandemic has presented an opportunity for accelerated digital transformation.</p><p>The past 18 months have seen an enormous uptick in interest and use of digital health tools, including those enabling <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/what-will-next-year-look-telehealth-well-above-pre-pandemic-levels">telehealth</a>, <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/cdc-publishes-rates-covid-19-cases-deaths-vaccine-brand">COVID-19 testing and data sharing</a>, contact tracing and <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/vaccine-credential-tools-proliferate-ensuring-health-equity-key">vaccine verification passes</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>But as Dr. Patrice Harris points out, not every tool is appropriate for every person, or every situation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Innovators can and should ask themselves: "What can we do to not be a one-size-fits-all solution, but be complementary to a cadre of solutions?" said Harris, past president of the American Medical Association and cofounder and CEO of at-home testing vendor eMed. &nbsp;</p><p>Harris spoke with <i>Healthcare IT News</i> about how the federal government and other stakeholders can support innovation, the best ways to ensure digital health tools don't exacerbate disparities, and how eMed hopes to play a role in filling the COVID-19 at-home testing gap. &nbsp;</p>
