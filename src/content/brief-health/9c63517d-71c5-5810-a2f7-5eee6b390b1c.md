<p>Neural networks, or deep learning, is a capability that is changing the way people live and work.
How do healthcare executives know the potential data objectives faced can be addressed with deep learning?
Next month in his HIMSS22 educational session entitled "Demystifying Deep Learning and Neural Networks," Michael Meighu, a director at CGI, an IT and business consulting firm, will simplify the subject matter so all attendees can understand what is at stake.
Q. Please help a layperson better understand deep learning/neural networks by reframing the concept in everyday language.
A. Deep learning/neural networks is not magic or something mystical.
After that exercise, you can give them new unlabeled dogs and cat photographs, and by some learning human mechanism, they can label them on their own correctly.
Computer neural networks or deep learning is a pattern recognition algorithm inspired by the biological one.
Q. What are the key components of a deep learning/neural networks project?
A. There are many key components in a deep learning project, and ironically, the actual neural network is probably the simplest component.
This represents a metaphor regarding the key components in a deep learning project.
The key components of a deep learning project go way beyond the technology and must include actual alignment of the training data, the business question and the personnel performing the work.</p>
