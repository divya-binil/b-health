<p>In <i>The Matrix</i>, Morpheus offers Neo the choice between two pills in the iconic ‘Blue Pill Or Red Pill’ scene; take the red pill and Neo learns life-changing truths or take the blue pill and Neo maintains his blissful ignorance. We could adapt this choice to healthcare A.I. nowadays.</p><p>Would you be willing to contribute your personally-identifiable biometric data to a for-profit company that stands to gain millions off your information by developing a “red pill-powered” A.I. in the hopes of improving healthcare?&nbsp;</p><p>If not, would you then be willing to let healthcare professionals use an undertrained, “blue pilled” A. I. to make decisions that will impact your well-being? This sick twist to Morpheus’ choice is a paradox that we are experiencing today with A. I. in healthcare: compromise our data for better, truth-seeking A. I. or keep our data for poorly-performing ones ignorant of real clinical data. And there are already examples to show for.</p>
