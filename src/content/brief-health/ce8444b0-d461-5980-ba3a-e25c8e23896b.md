<p>Children’s Hospital &amp; Medical Center launched its Children’s GO mobile app that combines a variety of digital offerings into one single "entrance." The only hospital in Nebraska solely dedicated to paediatric care is the Children's Hospital &amp; Medical Center in Omaha, which serves a five-state area. With the opening of the Hubbard Center for Children in 2022, it almost doubled its capacity, adding 100 beds for a total of 243 beds. The hematology/oncology floor, the cardiac care centre, the neonatal intensive care unit, and the paediatric intensive care unit were all extended as a result of this shift. A larger café, a family waiting area, an expanded gift shop, and more visitor parking spaces are just a few of the upgraded facilities that the new facility provides to patient families. With the expansion, a series of new difficulties emerged, including how to make sure families could find their way simply from one location to another.</p>
