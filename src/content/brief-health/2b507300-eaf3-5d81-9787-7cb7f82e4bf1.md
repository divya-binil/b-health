<p>A common business strategy nowadays is to invest in custom software solutions because the idea of digital healthcare puts patients, their individual needs, and demands for comfort and speed at the heart. However, the use of technology in healthcare goes far beyond a transitory fad. Instead, it is an essential component of every healthcare company's success since it aids in the transformation of current procedures into long-term improvements in cost and efficiency. A competitive edge and market positioning can also be secured by healthcare organisations by incorporating some of the most recent software technology. My position as a software developer for the healthcare industry enables me to understand the full untapped potential of current technologies.</p>
