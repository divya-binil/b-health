<p>The Aetion Evidence Platform® will support Evio's data-driven efforts to ensure every patient receives the right medication for their unique situation, from the beginning.
DENVER and NEW YORK, Aug. 4, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Evio, an independent pharmacy solutions company dedicated to ensuring every patient receives the right medications in a simple and affordable way, today announced a new collaboration with Aetion, a global real-world evidence (RWE) technology and analytics provider, to drive increased use of RWE in pharmacy solutions and decision-making.
The agreement enables Evio to leverage the Aetion Evidence Platform® (AEP), which is scientifically validated software that transforms real-world data into transparent, reliable, and replicable RWE and patient insights.
"The combination of Aetion's robust platform and Evio's vision to transform decision making will create a new paradigm for helping health plans move beyond clinical trial data to give their members access to the right treatments for them," said Bill Guptail, Aetion's Senior Vice President of Value-Based Solutions.
Evio is an independent pharmacy solutions company that works with health plans to transform the medication experience for everyone: patients, providers, health plans, and the system at large.</p>
