<p>The Medical Futurist's latest infographic about the impact of technologies on medical specialties - or how innovation fosters creativity in healthcare. In 20 years, when robot surgeons perform the dirty job in the operating room, will digital assistants dispense medication and sophisticated algorithms identify patients with cancerous lesions based on CT scans, fully replacing doctors? Although extremely unlikely, there are numerous worries about the development of digital health technology to the point that doctors will no longer be needed. The influence of the rapid innovation taking place in healthcare across a range of medical specialisations should be acknowledged, even though we think that concerns about technology, particularly AI, replacing doctors are misplaced. Our infographic provides an illustration of this. Every industry, including the medical field, is experiencing a high level of hype and anxiety about technologies, particularly those involving artificial intelligence and intelligent robots taking over occupations.</p>
