<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>     <div>         <div>             <p><strong>19 August 2022:</strong> Adherium Limited (ASX: ADR), a leader in respiratory eHealth, remote monitoring and data management solutions, is pleased to announce a collaboration with Trudell Medical Limited to service Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients in the US.</p> <p>The partnership will utilize the strength and expertise of Trudell’s US operation, Monaghan Medical, and its wholly owned subsidiary Aetonix’s aTouchAway® platform integrated with Adherium’s Hailie® sensors to monitor COPD patients discharged from the hospital to reduce readmissions and improve patient outcomes.</p> <p>Mr Rick Legleiter, Adhierum’s Chief Executive Officer, explained, “This is an excellent program of industry partners working together to solve a burdensome and costly healthcare need and we get paid for generating and transmitting data and insights. Our serviceable market is the 8.5 million severe and difficult to treat Asthma and COPD patients in the US. There are approximately 700,000 inexcusable and unacceptable annual COPD hospitalizations which is a sweeping call to action for better patient management upon discharge from hospital and readmission prevention. Doctors, hospital systems and payors all want this improvement.”</p> <p>In the US, COPD is the third leading cause of 30-day hospital readmissions.&nbsp; COPD is costly with almost US$50 billion in direct costs annually.&nbsp; Acute exacerbations of COPD are responsible for up to 70% of COPD-related healthcare costs; hospital readmissions alone account for over US$15 billion annually.&nbsp;</p> <p>The aTouchAway® platform uses customized complex care pathways that allow health care professionals to safely and effectively provide remote care to individuals with chronic conditions, such as COPD, ensuring the continuum of care and has been proven to reduce the length of stay in hospitals and a significant decrease in unnecessary readmissions.</p> <p>The integration of Hailie digital sensors into the aTouchAway platform will provide clinicians with the information to track inhaler medication adherence and respiratory physiological parameters such as inhalation flow rate and possible rescue inhaler overuse as key additional data insights to help detect potential issues leading to readmissions.</p> <p>Mr Gerald Slemko, Trudell Medical’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Trudell Medical Limited continues to pursue its vision of putting the patient first by relentlessly pursuing new innovations and building trust within the respiratory community. The recent acquisition of Aetonix and its aTouchAway software, a fully developed virtual patient management platform for complex care pathways, and our collaborative partnership with Adherium continues our pursuit of helping patients lead better lives.”</p> <p>This COPD program is focused on collecting real world clinical data for minimizing readmission rates with a goal of improving patient management and reducing health system cost.&nbsp; Adherium’s recent US market release of the Hailie sensor for AstraZeneca’s Symbicort® inhaler along with the FDA 510(k) clearance of the Hailie sensor for GlaxoSmithKline’s Ellipta® inhalers, both with physiological parameter capabilities, represent key Adherium milestone achievements as development progresses, expanding Hallie sensor market coverage in CY23 to 18 of the top 20 US branded inhaler medications representing 99% of the market.</p> <p>Mr Legleiter, continued, “Our Trudell and Adherium partnership for Hallie remote monitoring combined with aTouchAway integrated care when patients return home from hospital helps enhance their safety feeling and improve quality of life after they are discharged.”</p>         </div>     </div> </section></div>
