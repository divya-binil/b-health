<p>Three experts from several fields cautioned delegates at RSNA22 about the possible risks of AI being used to undermine clinician-developed algorithms or create erroneous pictures in radiology. During RSNA22, the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, on Monday morning, Nov. 28, at Chicago's McCormick Place, three experts from various fields examined the likelihood that cybercrime will affect the field of radiology as well as artificial intelligence development in radiology and throughout healthcare, and they issued ominous warnings about the potential for harm to patients and patient care organisations as AI adoption expands in healthcare.
