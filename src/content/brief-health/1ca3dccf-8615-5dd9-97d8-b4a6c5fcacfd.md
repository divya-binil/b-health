<p>The study, from MetroHealth and Case Western Reserve University, suggests the AI-powered EHR system can help alert clinicians before symptoms become visible and potentially deadly to patients.<br><br>A new independent study in the Journal of Critical Care Medicine found that Epic's sepsis early warning system led to faster antibiotic administration and better patient outcomes without an increase in harmful clinical interventions, like antibiotic or IV fluid overdose.</p><ul><li>But the new independent study, conducted by MetroHealth and Case Western Reserve University, shows the use of EHR sepsis warning systems flags clinicians before symptoms become visible and potentially deadly to patients.</li><li>Q. Physicians and nurses get plenty of warnings during the course of their day.</li><li>This two-step approach meant they could focus on all four steps of the clinical alerting process: the model to aide in monitoring and alerting the right person at the right time, then a workflow to map out a response to the alert that fit the needs of the clinicians, and finally process measures and clinical outcomes to assess if the approach helped improve care.</li></ul>
