<p>COVID-19 has limited access to health services and placed a huge burden on economies; inspiring countries to look for digital solutions to improve the quality of health services, making them more responsive to people’s needs.
Called CroDiab, the registry is a web-based system for the collection of information on diabetic patients, which allows health professionals to focus on their individual needs and choose better treatment options.
Since 2004, use of this digital database has been mandatory for all primary and secondary health-care physicians who have patients with diabetes in their care.
A national electronic cancer data collection system in Georgia makes the cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment process more efficient for patients and doctors, and allows the government to better devise cancer management strategies.
In the European Region, digital solutions are helping more and more people to enjoy and share the benefits of quality health care and to learn more about healthier choices and lifestyles.</p>
