<p>One of the first rare-disease studies focused on Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency has been launched thanks to a partnership between SEQSTER PDM, Inc. ("SEQSTER") and PatientsLikeMe (PLM), leaders in patient-centric healthcare data technologies and patient engagement (AATD). The goal of the project is to gain a greater understanding of how enhanced digital real-time data, peer support, and practical evidence can be used to diagnose patients with AATD more quickly, reduce care inequities, and improve patient outcomes. Chris Renfro-Wallace, Chief Operating Officer of PatientsLikeMe, said, "We have been working with SEQSTER for the past year building a best-in-class operating system to empower rare disease patients and researchers with longitudinal health data in real-time." "With the help of this study, SEQSTER and PLM have a rare opportunity to combine diverse patient health data on a single platform and increase involvement with the study."</p>
