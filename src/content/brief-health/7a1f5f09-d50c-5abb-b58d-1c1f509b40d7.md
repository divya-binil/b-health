<p>According to a study published in JAMA Network Open, providing a video-enabled tablet to veterans living in rural areas decreased emergency department visits and suicide behaviors.<br><br>Providing video-enabled tablets to rural veterans decreased emergency department visits and suicide behaviors, and increased both in-person and virtual mental health visits, according to a study published in JAMA Network Open.
"These findings suggest that video-enabled tablets may provide access to critical services for rural patients with mental health needs and reduce instances of suicide behavior and ED visits among them," the authors wrote.
Researchers found that receiving a video-enabled tablet with a data plan was associated with an overall 20% reduction in the likelihood of an emergency department visit, a 36% decrease in likelihood of a suicide-related visit and a 22% reduction in the likelihood of suicide behavior among U.S. veterans living in rural areas.
"These findings suggest that the VA and other health systems should consider leveraging video-enabled tablets for improving access to mental health care via telehealth and for preventing suicides among rural residents," the authors wrote.</p>
