<p>The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) has awarded funds to 11 research institutions to establish and support regional comprehensive research centers on the prevention, treatment, and management of comorbid chronic diseases that disproportionately affect populations with health disparities.
“The same social determinants of health – access to nutritious food, safe housing and quality education - influence disparities in multiple chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, cancer, oral health, and HIV,” said Stuart Gansky, DrPH, co-director of the coordinating center for the projects at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), in a statement.
Center to Improve Chronic disease Outcomes through Multilevel and Multi-generational approaches Unifying Novel Interventions and Training for health Equity (The COMMUNITY Center) Columbia University Health Sciences
The COMMUNITY Center will focus on reducing health disparities in chronic diseases in the New York City region through rigorous testing, disseminating, and sustaining interventions that incorporate the multiple levels of influence from individual, interpersonal, community, and societal approaches.
The center will establish advanced interdisciplinary research on cardiometabolic disease in Asian Americans that will inform population health, clinical practice, and health policy at multiple levels.</p>
