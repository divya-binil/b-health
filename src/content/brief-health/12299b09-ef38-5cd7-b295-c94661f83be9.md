<p>Healthcare institutions' motivations for innovation are to improve patient experience, stay relevant and support the changing care model (i.e., remote care and monitoring).
Generally, they are slower to innovate as they need to decide which services to digitalise, but they have the innate ability to offer more in-depth healthcare services.
They are quicker to innovate and deploy telehealth solutions but their continued growth involves offering more services through partnering or by acquisitions.
