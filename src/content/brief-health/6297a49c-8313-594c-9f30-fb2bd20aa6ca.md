<p>You don’t need another story urging you to “get to the cloud.” That’s old news for healthcare executives, who’ve long understood the necessity of rebooting the way their organizations operate in the digital era.
These executives and their organizations who aren’t moving as much of their operations and data to the public cloud simply because they can, but because they clearly can achieve better business and operational outcomes once they’re there.
They’re using the increased accessibility of healthcare data lakes, AI and machine learning, and other technologies to rapidly transform their data, improve their ability to spot trends and patterns with predictive analytics, and of course ensure and enhance their data security, governance, and regulatory compliance.
That’s why we’re approaching a turning point: There are massive untapped opportunities for healthcare leaders, even as they’re moving full-speed ahead with their digital transformations.
Given the ubiquitous nature of cloud-enabled digital healthcare today, third-party experts bring tested solutions and results that further speed up their path to data-driven operations and advanced analytics.
Data-driven healthcare operations can both improve patient outcomes — the most critical goal of all — while actually reducing costs.
Strategic healthcare leaders will do both, by relying on data-driven operations and advanced analytics to simultaneously improve patient outcomes and transform their businesses.</p>
