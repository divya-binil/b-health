<p>Five CIOs, a COO and a CMIO chart a course for the complex demands of data exchange, and discuss the technologies and strategies they plan to focus on in the next five years.<br><br>Interoperability is one of the most complex and challenging imperatives for healthcare. But it's a matter healthcare chief information officers and other health IT leaders must tackle.</p><p>A good way of understanding interoperability and how to solve it is by looking at where healthcare-provider organizations will be making interoperability investments in&nbsp;the future. That's what <i>Healthcare IT News</i> is doing in this second article in its latest feature series, "Health IT Investment: The Next Five Years."</p><p>For this series, we speak with health IT leaders, primarily chief information officers (CIOs), to learn from them the path forward through the priorities they set with their investments in six categories: AI and machine learning; interoperability; telehealth, connected health and remote patient monitoring; cybersecurity; electronic health records and population health; and emerging technology and other systems. <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/how-cios-are-prioritizing-ai-investments-next-5-years">Click here</a> to read the first feature, on AI and machine learning.</p>
