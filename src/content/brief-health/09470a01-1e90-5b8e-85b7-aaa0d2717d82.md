<p>Ribbon Health, the market leader in healthcare provider data management, and Elation Health, the clinical-first platform driving the future of sustainable primary care, today announced a partnership to integrate Ribbon's provider data solution into Elation Health's primary care electronic health record (EHR) platform. With less administrative work and more time for patient care, more than 24,000 doctors in the Elation community will have access to Ribbon's provider directory data to enable their referral management workflows. In order to improve patient-provider matches that are both efficient and of high quality, Elation's clients will also have the ability to make use of Ribbon's insurance plan information, provider affiliations data, demographic data, and clinical focus areas.</p>
