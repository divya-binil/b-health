<p>An innovative neural chip has been developed by scientists at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland that can recognise and suppress symptoms of a number of neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. The closed-loop neuromodulation device, dubbed NeuralTree by the researchers, consists of a 256 channel sensor array, soft implanted electrodes, and a machine learning CPU. The device's energy efficiency also contributes to longer battery life. The device can recognise the indicators of imminent tremors or seizures, for example, and commence neurostimulation to minimise or avoid the symptoms. For people with neurological illnesses, neuromodulation holds out a great deal of promise, and the technology is advancing quickly. The idea of an implanted chip that can lessen or prevent neurological symptoms from developing sounds like something out of a science fiction movie.</p>
