<p>At MetroHealth, we serve the most vulnerable populations and neighborhoods in Cleveland and across Cuyahoga County. More than 50% of the people who depend on us are on Medicaid or uninsured. 100% of our Medicaid, 90% of our Medicare, and more than 60% of our commercial patients are under value-based contracts. MetroHealth is an essential safety net dedicated to high-quality, affordable, and equitable care. To that end, we committed to fully using Epic as our hospital system’s central nervous system, which helps us improve clinical and financial outcomes and paves the way for our future efforts.</p><p>Despite our patient mix, value-based obligations, and related challenges, MetroHealth increased our community benefit from $160 million to $240 million over the past eight years and improved our operating margin from less than 1% to more than 5%. We derived half of our 2019operating margin from quality measures and cost savings. Within the next five years, we expect that a greater percentage of our margin will be linked to avoiding unnecessary care and admissions than from surgical procedures or ED visits.</p>
