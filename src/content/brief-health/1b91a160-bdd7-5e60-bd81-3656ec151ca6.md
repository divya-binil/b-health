The ten startups, selected from more than 250 applicants, will participate in the four-week AWS Healthcare Accelerator program focused on health equity. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has selected ten early-stage startups to participate in the 2022 AWS Healthcare Accelerator for improving health equity. Selected from over 250 applicants, these health equity-focused startups brought forward ideas that aim to increase care access, reduce disparities by addressing social determinants of health (SDOH), or provide actionable health equity data. “This year’s cohort brought forward innovative ideas that will improve access to care, provide actionable health equity data, expand access to medical transport, and help people without a home reach housing and health goals,” Jeff Kratz, general manager of Worldwide Public Sector Partners at AWS, said in an AWS Public Sector blog post. The selection committee, which included AWS subject matter experts, KidsX team members, AWS healthcare customers, health equity experts, and digital health investors, judged applications on several factors, such as solution innovation, product-market fit, team experience, and health equity impact. Austin-based Closed Hoop.ai hopes their participation will help its healthcare-focused artificial intelligence and machine learning platform connect to healthcare organizations throughout the AWS and KidsX networks interested in using SDoH data to identify and reduce health disparities. “By leveraging the scalability and reliability of AWS service offerings, the ClosedLoop platform will help healthcare organizations leverage vast amounts of data from diverse sources to identify individuals with the most impactful health-related social needs.”
