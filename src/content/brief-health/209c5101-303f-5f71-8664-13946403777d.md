<p>If the answer is yes to any 2 of these questions, the announcement is in line with the digital health trends, so it is worth keeping an eye on it.<br><br>The method is simple: if the answer is yes to any 2 of these questions, the announcement is in line with the digital health trends and directions, so it is worth keeping an eye on it.
The first question you need to answer is why a given technology was developed.
When reading about new technology, always examine if it was only developed because it was possible (like Google Glass), or is it something that meets clinical or patient needs (like aFib detection)?
Keep an eye on new technologies that are addressing an existing pain point of healthcare professionals or patients.
We said only two of the six answers have to be yes to qualify as meaningful digital health tech, which implies that some solutions donâ€™t have to address clinical/patient needs and still be noteworthy.
Looking for digital health technologies like the study on the Kardia 6-lead device or the data on sepsis-watch A.I. will quickly lead you to studies and trials, be careful if you find none.
A principle definition of any digital health technology is that it provides relevant health information to the patient and the clinician as well.
Technologies accessible exclusively to doctors are either medical tech (an equally important, but totally different category) or a poorly designed digital health initiative, missing a crucial point.
Any technology that takes over non-essential tasks from doctors and nurses allowing them to practice empathy, and patient-focused care is helping the relationship.</p>
