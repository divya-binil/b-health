<p>We strongly believe that only digital health can bring healthcare into the 21st century and make patients the point-of-care.<br><br>Recently, I attended a virtual oncology congress as a speaker where one of the attending professors asked me about the IT infrastructure in medical practices. Knowing the medical reality, he inquired whether those existing computers and accompanying systems would allow the use of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (A.I.). Practically, he wanted to know how I think those hardware should be upgraded to make it ready for A.I.</p><p>To answer him, I made a seemingly unrelated analogy coming from the video game industry: cloud gaming. This approach, where the cloud handles all the processing power, has gained traction lately; bypassing the need for powerful PCs and consoles altogether. What if the same fate awaits medical professionals and hospitals with limited IT infrastructure that still want to benefit from power-hungry technologies like A.I.?</p>
