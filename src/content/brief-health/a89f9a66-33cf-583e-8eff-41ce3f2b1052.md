<p>The annual HealthTech Innovation Awards, which honour businesses creating waves in the healthcare and tech industries, are in their tenth year this year. The 2022 event took place Thursday night (November 23) at Dublin's Mansion House, where nine businesses received prizes. On the evening, winners included start-ups like SymPhysis Medical in Galway, SMEs like Clonallon Laboratories in Northern Ireland, and people like Kevin Carroll, who won the award for outstanding professional in the healthcare industry.
