<p>“Every person on my team manages their papers a different way,” says Morgan.
“There are a lot of products on the market designed for large institutional libraries,” says Park.
But after talking with our users, we saw a clear, unmet need for the tens of thousands of organizations in the middle: small to medium-sized companies that still need to access and manage literature from many different publishers, but don’t have massive budgets for it.”
From these conversations was born the DeepDyve Digital Library: a platform that is designed to make it easy and affordable for research organizations to discover, access, organize, and collaborate on peer-reviewed papers.
“We’ve been around for about ten years,” says Park, “We were founded by two guys in this exact situation—scientists who had just graduated and went to work for small companies and couldn’t believe how hard it suddenly was to find papers.” Park and his team, inspired by the changes that streaming music and video services had brought to digital media, decided to see if they could apply that same model to peer-reviewed journals.
So we built the Digital Library to be a one-stop platform that allows researchers to find and access virtually any paper, including ones that the organization has already purchased, all from one place, and easily organize those papers with their team.”</p>
