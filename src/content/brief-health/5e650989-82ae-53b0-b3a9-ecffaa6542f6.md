<p>We asked several healthcare executives to share their healthcare cybersecurity predictions and trends for 2023. The healthcare sector will continue to experience an upsurge in cyberattacks: Since the healthcare sector is the most susceptible to cyberattacks, it is a profitable target for cybercriminals; attacks on this sector have increased dramatically in 2022 and will continue to expand in 2023. Healthcare breaches cost $9.23 million on average each occurrence, according to IBM. Most importantly, cyberattacks have an influence on patients' mental health in addition to having a direct impact on human life. Additionally, 26% of respondents stated that the healthcare and public health sector is likely to face a successful ICS breach with impacts on safe and dependable operations, according to a recent SANS and OPSWAT report, "State of ICS/OT Cybersecurity in 2022 and Beyond."</p>
