<p>Nearing the end of 2021, we think of the end of the pandemic as a white sail gleams in the distance (and just as we publish this article, news arose of yet another virus mutant called omicron).
In terms of trust, healthcare had the most horrific year.
Conspiracy theories, misinformation, and more – 2021 was probably the worst year of all to experience these, for there was no greater need to trust science than now.
The rapid and much-needed adoption of digital solutions, from telemedicine to at-home lab tests, from disinfecting robots to the use of A.I. in research, overcame the infrastructural or even operational hurdles that stood before these solutions for a long time.
In the post-covid era, they had to accept the technology element in a matter of weeks – and now still nobody knows how to build those relationships through virtual calls.</p>
