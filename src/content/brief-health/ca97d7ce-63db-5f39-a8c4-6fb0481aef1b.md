<p>We strongly believe that only digital health can bring healthcare into the 21st century and make patients the point-of-care.<br><br>In 2021, we are yet in another race. A race to vaccinate the world. It was the news (or more likely, the miracle) we were eagerly waiting for: to have a functional vaccine against COVID-19 as soon as possible. And in less than a year since the WHO declared the state of pandemic, we have more than one such vaccine. Records <a href="https://www.engadget.com/covid-vaccine-research-and-development-150052906.html">were broken in vaccine development rates</a>, we have the hope we were looking for and the unspoken prophecy was fulfilled.</p><p>Now, several vaccines are approved in many countries and even by leading healthcare authorities; with millions of people already having been vaccinated. But this is not enough. We need billions to get their shot, or <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51665497">around 60-70% of the global population</a>, to achieve herd immunity and stop the virus’ spread definitively. And that’s in the best case scenario, with a vaccine working perfectly.</p>
