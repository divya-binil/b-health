<p>Authenticx, the new standard in healthcare for listening to customer voices at scale, today introduces a quality management solution to strategically analyze contact center conversations and proactively surface areas of improvement and opportunity.
Organizations can pair the new solution with other Authenticx features like Smart Sample™ to make patient-focused changes to their processes by gathering insights on agent quality. Not only have we made this possible at Authenticx, but our new quality offering advances the layers of insights to deliver improved QA scores, onboarding examples for new customer service agents and feedback for agents post-interaction to improve their skills. The customer used Authenticx's quality features in conjunction with Smart Sample™ to monitor patient-centric agent performance to assess how agent quality scores improved each month.</p>
