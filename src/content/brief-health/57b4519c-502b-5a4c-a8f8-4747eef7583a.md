<p>How new technologies are helping patients with diabetes better manage the disease.<br><br>For all the progress science and medicine have made over the last century in treating diabetes-particularly adult-onset diabetes-we haven’t done a very good job of preventing it.</p><p>Unlike cancer, which has seen <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics">declining incidence rates</a> in the U.S. since the early 1990s, diagnosed diabetes rates have doubled over the last 20 years. On the current pace, 40% of Americans will be living with diabetes or prediabetes within the next few years, and diabetes-related spending and lost productivity will cost the country $500 billion annually within the next decade.</p><p>It is one of the nation’s costliest public health emergencies-and it will remain so, unless we make a coordinated effort to bend the curve. I talk to clinicians and subject-matter experts about diabetes care often, and have come to understand there are a few ways we should approach this:</p><p><strong>1. Team-based care&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Historically, patients living with <a href="https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/biggest-barrier-prevents-physicians-providing-optimal-chronic-care">chronic conditions</a> like diabetes might have seen their primary care physician three or four times a year. Apart from those visits, they were on their own when it came to managing their disease.</p>
