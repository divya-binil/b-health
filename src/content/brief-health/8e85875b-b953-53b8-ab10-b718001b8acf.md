<p>WASHINGTON, DC, July 28, 2022 – The <a href="https://www.aacnnursing.org/">American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN)</a> is pleased to announce that 50 schools of nursing from 28 states have been selected to participate in a national initiative designed to foster inclusive learning environments and build a more diverse nursing workforce.&nbsp;</p><p>In January 2022, AACN commenced a project titled <a href="https://www.aacnnursing.org/News-Information/Press-Releases/View/ArticleId/25189/AACN-Launches-New-National-Initiative-Focused-on-Building-a-Culture-of-Belonging-in-Schools-of-Nursing">Building a Culture of Belonging in Academic Nursing</a> with funding from Johnson &amp; Johnson. AACN launched this initiative to help schools of nursing create environments where students, faculty, and staff possess a strong sense of belonging and are encouraged to thrive.</p><p>“Creating a learning culture where all individuals are able to develop and do their best work is critical to achieving academic nursing’s goals related to diversity, equity, and inclusion,” said Dr. Deborah Trautman, AACN President and Chief Executive Officer. “AACN is pleased to join with 50 member schools to pilot test a new tool that will help to evolve how nurse educators approach teaching, learning, and professional engagement.”</p><p>To support this project, AACN developed a digital platform to administer its Leading Across Multidimensional Perspectives (LAMP®) Culture and Climate Survey. This instrument collects data on student, faculty, and staff perceptions of their college classrooms as communities in five thematic areas: fair treatment and observations of discrimination, belongingness, value of diversity and inclusion, campus services, and clinical training.</p><p>Using data collected via LAMP, AACN will provide institution-level assessments and action reports to participating schools related to developing inclusive academic environments. This tool provides administrators with a better understanding of how their campus climate influences student experiences and achievement. With assessment data from internal stakeholders, educators are equipped with valuable information needed to initiate change, target areas of growth, and most importantly, improve student outcomes. AACN will also use aggregate data collected from participating schools to identify best practices and success strategies that can be deployed at institutions nationwide.</p><p>Following a call for pilot schools that netted nearly 250 applicants, the following schools were selected to participate in the next administration of the LAMP survey:</p><p>Arizona College of Nursing<br>Baylor University<br>Binghamton University<br>California State University, Stanislaus<br>Case Western Reserve University<br>Chamberlain University&nbsp;<br>Charles R. Drew University of Medicine &amp; Science<br>Emory University<br>Florida Atlantic University<br>Frontier Nursing University<br>Jefferson College of Nursing<br>Loyola University of New Orleans<br>LSU Health New Orleans<br>New York University&nbsp;<br>North Dakota State University<br>Oregon Health &amp; Science University<br>Pace University<br>Prairie View A&amp;M University&nbsp;<br>Purdue University Northwest<br>Randolph-Macon College<br>Rush University<br>Rutgers University<br>Shenandoah University<br>Stockton University<br>Stony Brook University<br>SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University<br>Texas Tech University Health Science Center<br>The University of Alabama<br>The University of Alabama at Birmingham<br>The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center<br>University of Cincinnati<br>University of Colorado<br>University of Detroit Mercy<br>University of Iowa&nbsp;<br>University of Maryland<br>University of Memphis<br>University of Michigan - Flint<br>University of New Mexico<br>University of North Carolina at Greensboro<br>University of North Carolina Pembroke<br>University of Portland<br>University of South Florida<br>University of Southern Maine<br>University of Texas at Arlington<br>University of Texas Medical Branch<br>UTHealth Houston<br>Western Governors University<br>Widener University<br>Wilmington University<br>University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</p><p>Schools selected to participate in this pilot study are geographically diverse and represent a range of institutional types (public and private institutions; small and large schools; rural and urban-serving programs, etc.) Having a broad range of participating schools is important to securing results that can be generalizable across all types of nursing schools. &nbsp;</p><p>Pilot testing of the LAMP survey will be completed in spring 2023. AACN will disseminate aggregate findings to all schools of nursing next year. For more information on this initiative and the LAMP Culture and Climate Survey, contact AACN’s Associate Director for&nbsp;Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Christine Downing, at <a href="mailto:cdowning@aacnnursing.org">cdowning@aacnnursing.org</a>.</p>
