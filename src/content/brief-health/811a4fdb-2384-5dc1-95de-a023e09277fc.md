<p>The way we think about the future of information and data has been completely transformed by blockchain technology. Blockchain technology, at its most basic level, provides for the decentralisation of data, or the transfer of information control from a centralised entity (such as an individual or organisation) to a dispersed network. The use of a distributed network for information control allows society to improve the data's transparency, trust, and integrity. A distributed database of records, or public ledger, of all executed transactions or digital events that have been shared among participating parties is what blockchain is essentially, according to the authors of an early whitepaper published by the University of California Berkeley's Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship &amp; Technology. The public ledger's transactions are all independently confirmed by consensus.</p>
