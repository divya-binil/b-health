<p>A Baltimore medical center that suffered a ransomware attack a month ago and pulled its <a href="http://www.healthcareinfosecurity.com/electronic-health-records-c-252">electronic health records</a> system offline as a precaution during the recovery is finally beginning to restore access to the system, the organization's CEO says.</p><p>The situation in Baltimore is the latest example of how a ransomware incident can cripple a healthcare organization's ability to access and use EHR systems following an attack, regardless of whether those systems were actually infected by the malware.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.gbmc.org/dr-chessare-covid-update-01-06-2021">video</a> posted on Wednesday, John Chessare, M.D., president and CEO of GBMC Healthcare, updated patients about the organization's <a href="http://covid19.inforisktoday.com/">COVID-19</a> activities as well as the status of recovery from a cyberattack detected on Dec. 6.</p><p>The ransomware incident at GBMC, which operates the 342-bed Greater Baltimore Medical Center and several other facilities, caused the organization's "tightly connected systems," including phone systems and a patient portal, to go down, preventing patients from calling to make appointments and accessing their MyChart records, Chessare said.</p>
