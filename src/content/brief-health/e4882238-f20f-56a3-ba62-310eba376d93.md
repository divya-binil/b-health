<p>An international cybercrime gang known as Evil Corp has been harassing businesses with malware and ransomware attacks for more than ten years. And it appears that the gang now has its sights set on healthcare providers. The Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HSCCC), a division of the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, stated in an advisory released in late August that "Evil Corp should be regarded a substantial danger to the U.S. health sector." Evil Corp is one of many malicious actors operating all over the world who commit cybercrimes in an effort to access private information and occasionally to disrupt business operations, endangering patient care in healthcare systems around the world. According to the HSCCC in the advisory, hackers find the healthcare industry to be "an intriguing target".</p>
