<p>Health system employees often become patients of the healthcare entity, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/employers-employees-hipaa-oh-my-3521380/">creating </a>blurred lines for a health system regarding if and when it can access employees' medical records.&nbsp;</p><p>But, according to a <i>JD Supra</i> report, HIPAA laws do not apply to employment records held by a healthcare entity. However, individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by a covered entity in its healthcare capacity are treated as protected health information.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are three things healthcare providers should know about employee medical records:</p><p>1. If the records a healthcare entity needs to obtain are medical records of their employee, then HIPAA exceptions would apply.</p><p>2. A HIPAA-covered entity is only allowed to use or disclose protected health information for treatment, payment or healthcare operations.</p><p>3. If a health system needs to look into an employee's medical record, it must do so for an extremely limited purpose, as listed by the "healthcare operations exception."</p>
