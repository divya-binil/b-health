<p>Thanks for my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/ShereeseMayMba">Shereese Maynard</a> for <a href="https://twitter.com/ShereeseMayMba/status/1400427632353853440">pointing out</a> this <a href="https://investorplace.com/2021/06/cern-stock-might-be-the-target-of-an-acquisition-soon/">article</a> that suggests Cerner might be an acquisition target soon.&nbsp; The article makes the salacious statement that “Cerner is a wounded gazelle, and the lions are hungry.”</p><p>For those keeping track at home, we’ve been through this before when Jim Cramer suggested that <a href="https://www.healthcareittoday.com/2019/01/16/apple-should-acquire-epic-ehr-according-to-mad-moneys-jim-cramer/">Apple Should Acquire Epic</a>.&nbsp; Of course, Cramer said they “should” and the latest article says they “might be.”&nbsp; Both indicate a hedge which suggests they’re just pontificating and not really actually reporting on something they’ve found that would indicate this is near.&nbsp; When you remember that their business is about attracting eyeballs, then you at least read articles like these with that perspective.</p><p>As we cover the industry so deeply, I thought it might be worth taking a look at their arguments to see if they have any validity.&nbsp; Certainly, this will be of interest to those who currently use Cerner.</p><p>Core to the author (Dana Blankenhorn) of the article’s argument is that cloud companies are looking to roll up “the old enterprise software market by bringing preexisting industries into the cloud” and that healthcare is one of those industries.&nbsp; Along with that over arching concept is the fact that the CEO of Cerner is retiring and Cerner has done has had a good year, but not a great year with the most recent quarter showing less revenue than a year ago.</p>
