Manipal Hospitals has tapped Google Cloud to improve its virtual and remote care capabilities while leveraging AI to enhance patient experience. 

The partnership involves the deployment of the Amwell telehealth platform to enable virtual visits. Since 2020, Amwell has been Google&#39;s preferred telehealth partner to expand access to virtual care delivery worldwide. Google Cloud and Amwell are improving telehealth experiences through technologies that automate waiting room and checkout, provide automated language translation services, and intelligently triage cases.
