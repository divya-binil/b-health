<p>Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT or Bard, have great potential but also present tough hurdles for the medical and healthcare industries. We must ensure their safe deployment in a setting where lives are on the line if we are to realize their immense benefits. &nbsp;To put it another way, our goal is to create a strong, moral framework for these generative AI models without enforcing restrictions that prevent innovation. LLMs are now able to analyse photos, documents, handwritten notes, sound, and video in addition to text-based interactions. Consequently, we must manage the future as well as the present. A distinction between LLMs specifically trained on medical data and LLMs specifically educated for non-medical purposes will need to be made by the frameworks.</p>
