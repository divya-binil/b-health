<p>The attack affects operations across several states, with loss of access to medical records, and the scale of the data breach is still under investigation.
A major ransomware attack at CommonSpirit Health has been disrupting medical operations across several states for nearly two weeks, leaving the Chicago-based health system scrambling to maintain patient care while it conducts a forensics investigation and works to bring its electronic health record systems back online. After several days of cancellations and outage reports at CommonSpirit hospitals and medical facilities across several states, the country's biggest Catholic health system and second-largest nonprofit hospital chain released a statement this week about the widespread cybersecurity incident.
CommonSpirit officials said the attack has affected several facilities and that systems serving Dignity Health and Virginia Mason Medical Center are experiencing a minimal impact on operations.</p>
