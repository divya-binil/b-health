More than 24 health care organizations joined AHIMA in support of a proposal to require the use of US Postal Service standards for addresses in EHRs, and some also suggested using additional data captured in EHRs, such as email addresses and phone numbers, to improve patient matching. A recent study found that adopting the USPS standard could reduce the number of unlinked records by 20%, and standardizing surname as well could cut the number of unmatched records in half.
