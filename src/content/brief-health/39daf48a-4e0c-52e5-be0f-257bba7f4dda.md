<p>Users are able to get a list of potential conditions and send their information to their providers.<br><br>Google is looking to use artificial intelligence to help patients find answers to dermatology questions using their personal cameras.</p><p>"Skin diseases as a category are an enormous global burden and every day we see millions of people turning to Google to research their skin concern," Dr. Peggy Bui, product manager at Google Health, said. "Worldwide, two&nbsp;billion are affected, and most cases are curable. But half the world's population face a critical shortage of dermatologists where wait times can be months to a year."</p><p>This afternoon the tech titan revealed a preview of its AI-powered dermatology assistant that runs on a web-based application. Users are able to upload photos from their cameras onto the platform. The assistant can give feedback to the user on photo quality, telling them if a photo is too blurry or dark, etc.</p>
