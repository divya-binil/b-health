State-of-the-art analytics solutions are already available, but few of them are in use by clinicians.</p><p>At University of Virginia Health System, health leaders worked to establish a culture of data-driven decision-making with clinicians, with data science guides clinicians in finding opportunities for improvement, designing and implementing interventions, and evaluating impacts.</p><p>Bommae Kim, senior data scientist at Hackensack Meridian Health – and until last year with UVA Health, also as a senior data scientist – said a key challenge to wider adoption is lack of interest.</p><p>"Due to their disinterest or ambivalence to data science, it may be difficult to find opportunities to work with clinicians to begin with," she said.</p><p>Kim, who along with Dr. Jonathan Michel, director of data science at University of Virginia Health, will speak on the topic next month at HIMSS21. She said a lack of trust and a lack of understanding are two other challenges to adoption of analytics solutions</p>
