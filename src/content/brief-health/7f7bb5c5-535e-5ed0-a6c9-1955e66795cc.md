<p>On June 23, Myriad Genetics, a genetic testing and precision medicine company, announced a partnership with Epic, the industry leading healthcare software company, to integrate Myriad’s full line of genetic tests with Epic’s network of 600,000 physicians and more than 250 million patients.
The same day, the Tiger Institute for Health Innovation, which provides the technology for University of Missouri Health Care’s electronic health record (EHR), and Foundation Medicine, which provides genomic testing through blood and tissue samples, announced they have launched the partnership’s first fully automated genomic testing interface within the EHR.
Myriad said its Epic integration will create a seamless, end-to-end workflow solution for healthcare providers to order Myriad tests and review results directly within their everyday Epic platform without additional steps or manual ordering processes.
Patients will also be able to easily access their Myriad test results and other health information directly within their EHR portal.</p>
