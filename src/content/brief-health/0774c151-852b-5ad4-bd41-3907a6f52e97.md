<p>Several outlets had pointed to Dr. Robert Califf, who also led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2016, as the likely candidate prior to the official announcement.<br><br>President Joe Biden nominated Dr. Robert Califf as commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday.
If confirmed, Califf, a cardiologist who also led the FDA during the last year of President Barack Obama's administration, will step into a position that has been vacant for months.
"Dr. Robert Califf is one of the most experienced clinical trialists in the country, and has the experience and expertise to lead the Food and Drug Administration during a critical time in our nationâ€™s fight to put an end to the coronavirus pandemic," said Biden in a statement.
"I am confident Dr. Califf will ensure that the FDA continues its science and data driven decision-making," said Biden in his Friday statement.</p>
