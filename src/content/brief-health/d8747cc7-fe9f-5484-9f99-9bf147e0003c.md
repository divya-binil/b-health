<p>There are a few commonsense steps you can take to make 2023 a very successful year, starting with good scheduling systems and maintaining patient relationships. Until her death in 2020, Sally McKenzie had a significant influence in the dental industry. In an effort to preserve her excellent and perceptive writing and continue to inspire people, we are releasing this piece. Read more from Chris Salierno, DDS, about her legacy in the dentistry industry. You don't have to continue to struggle in the coming year if your practise has been struggling. Even if you feel overwhelmed and are unsure of where to begin, you may make a few modifications to transform your struggling practise into a thriving one. Here are a few pointers to help you turn things around. By implementing some or all of these improvements in 2023, you can increase productivity and expand your patient base. Acquiring new patients is a critical part of running a successful dental practice, and there are several common mistakes that can be made in this process. Here are a few to be aware of:</p><ul><li>Failing to effectively market the practice: Marketing is essential to reaching new patients, and practices that don't have a clear and effective marketing strategy are likely to struggle to attract new business.</li><li>Ignoring online presence: With the rise of the internet and social media, having a strong online presence is crucial for attracting new patients. Failing to maintain an up-to-date and professional website, as well as an active social media presence, can hurt a practice's ability to reach potential patients.</li><li>Neglecting patient reviews and feedback: Patient reviews and feedback can provide valuable insights into what patients like and dislike about a practice, and can help practices make improvements to attract more patients. Failing to respond to negative reviews and feedback, or not making changes based on this feedback, can harm a practice's reputation and ability to attract new patients.</li><li>Not offering a range of services: Patients are more likely to choose a practice that offers a wide range of services, and failing to offer a comprehensive suite of services can limit the practice's ability to attract new patients.</li><li>Not utilizing technology: Incorporating technology into a practice, such as electronic health records and digital radiography, can improve the patient experience and make the practice more attractive to new patients.</li><li>Poor customer service: Providing excellent customer service is essential to acquiring and retaining patients. Dental practices that are known for poor customer service, long wait times, or rude staff members are likely to struggle to attract new patients.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, avoiding these common mistakes can help dental practices more effectively attract and retain new patients. By focusing on effective marketing, a strong online presence, responding to patient feedback, offering a comprehensive range of services, utilizing technology, and providing excellent customer service, dental practices can build a strong reputation and grow their patient base.</p>
