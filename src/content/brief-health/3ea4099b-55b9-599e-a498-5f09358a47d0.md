<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare and medicine are becoming more and more common. AI can be supplied data on which to base wise judgements about diagnosis and prognoses, and by definition should be able to find the best solution given a situation.</p><p>Systems that use AI learn from data exposure rather than being expressly coded by an algorithm. The system ought to find the best answer for a given issue, transforming it from a human-made algorithm into a more autonomous computational intelligence. The layers of the AI independently analyse the input and extract some kind of useful knowledge, which finally enables it to make a choice that is accurate for the situation it is in.</p>
