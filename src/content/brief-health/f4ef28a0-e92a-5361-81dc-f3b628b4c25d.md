<p>AI can be used to learn the right protocols for achieving standardised care for different conditions, says <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/audio/forbes-india-daily-tech-brief-podcast/instagram-testing-new-collab-in-india-clubhouse-no-longer-inviteonly-and-ajit-narayanan-on-ai-in-healthcare-at-mfine/69297">Ajit Narayanan</a>, CTO at Mfine, one of India’s most popular online health services company. Founded in 2017, Mfine lets users consult <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/coronavirus/is-telemedicine-here-to-stay/58649/1">doctors online</a>, order medicines and use an AI-based self-check feature for specific diseases. It is not a replacement for a doctor by any means, but a way to take more informed decisions.<br><br>&nbsp;Although the use of AI has been around for some time, Narayanan says, in areas like medical imaging, <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/special/mfine-puts-primary-care-in-your-palm-when-you-need-it/50431/1">Mfine</a> is trying to bring AI into the consumer space. For over 1,000 conditions, it has a virtual doctor to gather information needed from a patient, and summarises them for a human doctor. The summary offers investigation details, pointers on the diagnosis and what possible treatment. The patients can’t see this, but doctors see it on their Mfine-for-doctors app. “Doctors benefit from the investigation done using AI,” Narayanan says.</p>
