<p>Looking further than 6 months ahead is a daunting task given the volatility of the last 2 years. Peering even farther into 2025 seems an impossibility even though it is right around the corner.</p><p>In a recent eBook publication, CorroHealth partnered with Healthcare IT Today to predict what the transformation of healthcare RCM (Revenue Cycle Management) will look like by 2025. The eBook, <a href="https://corrohealth.com/revcycle2025"><strong>Road to 2025: Five Revenue Cycle Management Trends That Are Shaping the Future of Healthcare</strong></a><strong>, </strong>compiled insights from industry data that point in the direction of several predictions RCM professionals should watch over the next few years.</p><p>Some gradual and some aggressive changes are anticipated regarding the health and advancement of Revenue Cycle Management. Spoiler alert, the five areas where the most change will be seen include:</p><ol><li>Continued labor challenges</li><li>Advances in artificial intelligence</li><li>Prior Authorization requirements</li><li>The march to new payment models</li><li>Increasing value of and complexity with patient payments</li></ol><p>The RCM space is dealing with over 60% of hybrid workers at risk of leaving.</p><p>80% of leading health systems who invested in Artificial intelligence expect it to help improve financial performance.</p><p>The importance of technology in prior authorizations canâ€™t be ignored with the cost of a fully electronic transaction less than 20% the cost of manual.</p><p>RCM continues to establish closer working relationships with their clinical counterparts as Value Based Care expands its impact.</p><p>Patient payments are growing in importance given 31% of covered US workers enrolled in High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs) in 2020.</p>
