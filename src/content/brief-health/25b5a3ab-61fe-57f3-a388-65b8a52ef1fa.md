<p>The number one mistake Dr. Roxie has seen innovators make is "not looking at things through an early adopter lens". Learn more about what that means, and how you can put it into action in your company today. Plus, loads of additional wisdom to help you bring your healthcare innovation to market.<br><br>95% of innovations that are brought to market fail to reach an adequate level of customer adoption or financial ROI. It sounds scary, but it doesn’t have to be this way. Today we’re talking with healthcare commercialization strategist and digital health advisor Dr. Roxie Mooney, about the steps innovators can take to dramatically increase their chances of being in the other 5%.</p><ul><li>Why you need an early adopter strategy that focuses on the specifics needs, goals, and desires of the customers who are looking for something new and novel.</li><li>How to avoid pilot purgatory by negotiating future sales up-front and ensuring you can get value from the pilot along the way.</li><li>The risks of falling in love with your idea and skipping the all-important customer discovery and market validation step. And no, your mom is not a good source of feedback on your innovation.</li><li>The benefits of being strategic with your go-to-market timing (i.e., don’t rush to market; do rush to customer feedback).</li><li>How to co-create with your clients without building a product that works only for them.</li><li>When to convert your early-adopter messaging (i.e., new, never been done before, innovative, etc.) to mainstream messaging (i.e., social proof, trustworthy, reliable, ROI, etc.).</li></ul>
