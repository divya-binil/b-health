<p>Medical devicemaker MicroTransponder wrapped up a $53 million Series E funding round led by US Venture Partners.
The company said it will use the capital to commercialize its Vivistim vagus nerve stimulation system, an implantable device that aims to improve hand and arm mobility in stroke patients.
Payer-focused healthcare data startup Abacus Insights scooped up $28 million in Series C funding, bringing its total raise to $81 million.
Self-pay healthcare marketplace Sesame raised $27 million in a Series B round led by GV.
"Sesame provides greater access to healthcare for a meaningful percentage of the population, and we're inspired by the company's mission to drive better patient outcomes for underserved communities," Cathy Friedman, executive venture partner at GV, said in a statement.</p>
