<p><i>New research from Innovaccer shows most healthcare organizations are working to enable digital transformation, with only a few being entirely “digitally ready”</i></p><p>SAN FRANCISCO—Oct.&nbsp; XX, 2021—(PR NEWSWIRE)—Today <a href="https://innovaccer.com/">Innovaccer Inc</a>., the Health Cloud company, released the 2021 edition of “The Science of Digital Transformation in Healthcare and Why It’s Vital for Payer-Provider Collaboration.” The 14-page report assessed more than 4,000 survey responses from healthcare professionals over the first six months of 2021. The responses highlighted the crucial elements for success in value-based care contracts and how health cloud and data activation technologies can accelerate transformation through increased connectivity, data unification, analytic insights, and data transparency.</p><p>The report provides insights into healthcare organizations’ progress toward digital transformation. It also explores how cloud computing fits into payers’ and providers’ priorities and how organizations with upgraded technologies have streamlined operations, reduced costs, improved patient experiences, and achieved clinical excellence.</p><p>Survey findings show that while just 10% of healthcare organizations said they’ve completed their digital transformation, most respondents are planning (23%) or actively working (49%) to enable digital transformation. Another 16% are actively seeking a partner to develop and initiate a plan. 2.5% reported they don’t know where or how to start.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
