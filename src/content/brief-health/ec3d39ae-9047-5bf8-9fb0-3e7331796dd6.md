title: Addressing Misinformation In Healthcare Through COVID-19 And Beyond
---

If there is one thing we’ve learned during the COVID-19 pandemic it’s that patients probably can’t get enough reliable communication from their trusted healthcare providers. There is so much misinformation out there, and providers are uniquely positioned to reach out to patients with accurate education about both the disease and how to take care of themselves and stay healthy in general.

There are a ton of examples of inaccurate information spreading like wildfire across the internet. False claims that COVID-19 “hates the sun” and can be prevented by sipping warm water have been widely circulated. There’s also a rumor that if you can hold your breath for 10 seconds without pain, you don’t have the virus. There was a run on Hydroxychloroquine when it was suggested it might prevent or cure COVID. While those in healthcare scoff at much of this, studies show that most people are susceptible to believing misinformation if it is presented in the right way. Unfortunately, when people believe these things, they put themselves and others at risk.
