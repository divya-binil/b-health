<p>‘The first time I sat down to use GPT…I had a moment of thinking the world has changed and will never be the same after this moment as it was before,’ says Aaron Neinstein, vice president of digital health at UCSF Health. The industry is abuzz about ChatGPT, an OpenAI chatbot that will debut in November 2022, and its possible effects on healthcare. Robert Wachter, M.D., professor and chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Health, recently hosted a Grand Rounds where several UCSF executives shared their opinions on the direction they believe this technology is headed as well as the functions of academic medical centres and health IT developers. The UCSF executives' lively and wide-ranging conversation is worth seeing in its entirety on YouTube, but I've selected some of the points that I think our readers will find most interesting. Wachter stated that ChatGPT is trained using a significant amount of online data.</p>
