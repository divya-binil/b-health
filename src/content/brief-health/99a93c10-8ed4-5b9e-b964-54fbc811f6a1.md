If ever there were a year for a company to show what it's truly made of, this is it.

While the uneven impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have created true winners and losers across the healthcare industry between providers, health IT companies and payers, they have also illuminated the strategy, creativity and stamina behind some of healthcare's most revolutionary companies.

In the spirit of recognizing how companies have responded to the roller coaster of 2020 while positioning themselves to best thrive in 2021, we are opening nominations for our 2021 Fierce 15 awards.
