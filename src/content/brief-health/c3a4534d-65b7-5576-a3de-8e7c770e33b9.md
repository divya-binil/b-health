<p><i>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</i>” This quote by Arthur C. Clarke pretty much sums up the future of surgery. It offers fantastic cooperation between humans and technology, which could elevate the level of precision and efficiency of surgeries so high we have never seen before. A.I., surgical robots, 3D printing and new imaging methods are already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/30/technology/robot-surgery-surgeon.html">used on a wide scale</a> of procedures. But there’s much more to the future of surgery than that.&nbsp;</p><p>Today only 3% of surgical procedures are performed by robots, although 15% of all operations <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/robotic-surgeries-surge-to-15-of-all-procedures-despite-limited-evidence/570370/">used robotic support</a> or assistance in the U.S. in 2020. There’s still a long way to go. We already dived deep into the tools and designs of hospitals <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/the-future-of-hospital-design-inside-the-point-of-care">in this article</a>; now it’s time to have a peek into the future of this highly technical department: surgery.</p>
