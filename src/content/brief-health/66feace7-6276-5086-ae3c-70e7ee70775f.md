<p>The backbone of society, unpaid carers perform a crucial job but can feel alone and unsupported. Research indicates that 70% of carers, including parents and carers of adults, have at least one severe mental health impact, and this backbone is now beginning to weaken. Even more concerning, the same survey found that more than half (52%) of people who are categorised as belonging to the sandwich generation those who are simultaneously caring for an aged parent and a child have had suicide thoughts. Our ability to care for one another is a fundamental aspect of who we are. This ability may be both lovely and intense, and it has an effect on our job, our relationships, and our health. Employers, healthcare facilities, and governments must now make investments in unpaid carer support that will last. This begins with acknowledging a caregiver's reality, comprehending the factors influencing the intensity of their caregiving, and directing them towards support services. Then, by utilising data and analytics, we are able to focus on the needs of both individuals and populations, take deliberate action that has a significant impact, and act before it is too late.</p>
