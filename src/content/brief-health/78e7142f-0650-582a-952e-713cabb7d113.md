    The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a cybersecurity
    briefing last week warning hospitals of zero-day attacks, which have doubled

    system flaw before the developers have identified it, and a single flaw
    exploited can put millions of patients at risk.

<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a cybersecurity briefing warning health systems about the threat of “zero-day attacks.”
Zero-day attacks occur when hackers weaponize an unknown vulnerability in a system to target the flaw before the developers have identified it.
Perhaps the most famous zero-day attack to date occurred in 2010 when the Stuxnet worm exploited multiple vulnerabilities in Windows systems and reportedly destroyed multiple centrifuges at a nuclear power plant in Iran.</p>
