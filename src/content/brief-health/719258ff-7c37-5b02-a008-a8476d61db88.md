<p>The biggest independent multi-specialty medical practise in Northern Ohio, NOMS Healthcare, chose Axuall to improve its workforce management, according to a recent announcement from Axuall. Through Axuall's Real-Time Clinician Data Network, Axuall and NOMS will use data and analytics to produce strong data streams and insights that will minimise inefficiencies, lower fatigue, improve patient access, and enable more effective clinical staff onboarding and deployment. Healthcare firms may now use data and analytics across their employee populations to inform better, quicker decisions about human capital management thanks to workforce intelligence technology. Workforce intelligence technology can be extremely important in ensuring that the workforce supply chain is operating as efficiently as possible as organisations battle to fill roles, deal with clinician burnout, satisfy patient demand, and achieve their financial goals.</p>
