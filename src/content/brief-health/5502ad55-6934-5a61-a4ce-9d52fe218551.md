<p>New York-based telehealth company doxy.me has recently automated its localisation efforts to further make its platform accessible to more patients and providers in Asia-Pacific and beyond.
Since the pandemic hit, doxy.me, a telehealth platform that began by facilitating virtual prenatal care for expectant mothers, saw a huge increase in its user base, from around 65,000 providers to more than one million.
Doxy.me has also adopted Lokalise Messages which provides live two-way chat translation in Intercom.
The telehealth platform can now automatically detect the browser language of a patient's device, allowing patients to read prompts and messages in their provider's online waiting room in their own language.
"At doxy.me, our mission is to provide healthcare access to all and so by making our interface accessible in patients' native languages, we have been able to remove a barrier to care with the goal of providing better patient telehealth outcomes," Palmer commented.</p>
