<p>The companies announced this week that Teladoc's Solo platform will be accessible within the Microsoft Teams environment.<br><br>Teladoc Health and Microsoft announced this week that they are teaming up to offer virtual care integration for health systems and hospitals. &nbsp;</p><p>According to a press release Wednesday, Teladoc will offer its Solo platform via the Microsoft Teams environment. &nbsp;</p><p>The collaboration is aimed at streamlining telehealth technology and administrative processes, say the organizations.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>"The ability to access Teladoc Health Solo directly through Microsoft Teams will allow clinicians the opportunity to seamlessly transition between business and clinical operations, freeing them of administrative tasks and enabling them to practice at the top of their license," said Joseph DeVivo, Teladoc president of hospitals and health systems, in an email to <i>Healthcare IT News</i>. &nbsp;</p><p>"Clearly, the market demand for this collaboration exists and we are always looking for innovative ways to improve patient care and increase health system efficiency," DeVivo added. &nbsp;</p>
