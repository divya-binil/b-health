<p>Medtronic and AWS, today announced a partnership to provide underserved communities with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted colonoscopy technology through AWS’s $40M Health Equity Assistance Program for colon cancer screening.
– Amazon Web Services will support the effort to provide Medtronic GI Genius™ intelligent endoscopy modules to facilities that primarily serve communities with low screening rates or where access to this technology is not currently available, to enable early detection, giving patients a better chance of survival.
It is the first-to-market, computer-aided polyp detection system powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that provides physicians with a powerful solution in the fight to screen, detect and prevent colorectal cancer and an increase of up to 14.4% absolute detection rate (ADR)(opens new window).</p>
