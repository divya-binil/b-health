<p>Myriad Genetics, Inc., (NASDAQ: MYGN), a leader in genetic testing and precision medicine, today announced a partnership with Epic, the industry leading healthcare software company, to integrate Myriad’s full line of genetic tests with Epic’s expansive network of 600,000 physicians and more than 250 million patients.
The integration creates a seamless, end-to-end workflow solution for healthcare providers to order Myriad tests and review results directly within their everyday Epic platform without additional steps or manual ordering processes.
With the ability to review pertinent health information, order tests, and receive results natively in Epic, providers will have the critical genetic insights and related information they need to drive better health outcomes and improve the patient experience.
Increasing access to genetic insights and integrating our tests into Epic’s vast network of healthcare systems represents a significant step forward to better serve patients and healthcare providers.
</p><p>This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements relating to the integration of the company’s genetic tests with Epic’s network of physicians and patients and the expected timing of the integration; the company’s growth plan to scale customer-centric, tech-enabled commercial capabilities with 600+ EHR integrations this year; the anticipated benefits of the integration, including that the integration will create an end-to-end workflow solution for healthcare providers to order Myriad tests and review results directly with their everyday Epic workflows, provide providers with critical genetic insights and related information they need to drive better health outcomes and improve the patient experience, and allow patients to easily access their Myriad test results directly from their EHR portal; and the company’s strategic imperatives under the caption. These “forward-looking statements” are management’s present expectations of future events and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those described in the forward-looking statements.</p>
