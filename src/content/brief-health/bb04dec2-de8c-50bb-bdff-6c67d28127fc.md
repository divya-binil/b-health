<p>From time to time, news arises about 3D printed organs. On such occasions, people usually think that a machine can already create readily available, implantable human organs. However, the reality is far from this optimistic image.&nbsp;</p><p>Researchers worldwide are working on possible solutions: from a group that printed a <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-11/24/c_139540203.htm">miniature kidney,</a>&nbsp;through technological solutions like BioAssemblyBot <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/bioprinting-hand-36609058">we wrote about earlier, </a>to entirely <a href="https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/carnegie-researchers-develop-fresh-new-method-of-3d-bioprinting-fully-sized-human-heart-models-179829/">new methods</a> that can lead to patient-specific heart tissue printing. The list is long and set in a clinical setting. We checked out where the technology stands today and where it might lead us in healthcare tomorrow.</p>
