<p>PayZen, a mission-driven fintech company tackling health care affordability for patients and providers with artificial-intelligence-powered financing solutions, announced a partnership with the Iowa Hospital Association and its subsidiary, ServiShare.
The partnership solidifies PayZen as the top patient financing platform for IHA's network of 117 hospitals, 17 health systems and the patients they serve.
By offering flexible payment options, PayZen looks to eliminate medical debt for Iowans and make health care more affordable in the face of a recession, while enabling providers to improve performance and provide the essential care needed for their communities.
</p><p>"Rural providers are under immense pressure to deliver quality care with limited resources, but with PayZen's unique approach to solving patient affordability, we can provide personalized financial solutions for all Iowans looking to access affordable health care across our member hospitals."
PayZen is a mission-driven health care fintech company that aims to tackle the growing patient payment responsibility problem with superior technology and a modern approach, "Care Now, Pay Later." By prioritizing the patient experience and cutting administrative burden, PayZen looks to improve the patient-provider relation and slice the impact of medical debt on both sides.</p>
