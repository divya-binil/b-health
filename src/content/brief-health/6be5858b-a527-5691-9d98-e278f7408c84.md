<p>Medication management-focused Arine raised $29 million, Epic-based virtual care platform KeyCare scooped up $24 million, and care coordination software company CareHarmony raised $15 million.
"The U.S. healthcare system is fractured and siloed, making it difficult for plans, providers and patients to align on safe and effective medication therapy," CEO and cofounder Yoona Kim said in a statement.
KeyCare, maker of a virtual care platform built with the Epic EHR, announced it had wrapped up a $24 million Series A round.
"We created KeyCare to make sure health systems had better options for expanding virtual care services to their patients in the most convenient and safest way possible," CEO and founder Dr. Lyle Berkowitz said in a statement. Care coordination software company CareHarmony raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by Maverick Ventures, with participation from Nashville Capital Network.
The startup said it will use the funds to develop its CareBlocks tool, which aims to help providers personalize care journeys for their patients.</p>
