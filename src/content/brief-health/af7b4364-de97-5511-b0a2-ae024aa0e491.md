      Vitals360® is an excellent solution for Point of Care, Remote Monitoring,
      and Telehealth. When used for all three, the synergies are amazing. An
      issue that every RPM company faces is training and support, particularly
      for those who use multiple connected devices. Vitals360® obviously solves
      the multiple connected device problem.

<p>VoCare on Thursday introduced its Vitals360 handheld medical monitoring tool, following its recent FDA 510(k) clearance as the first device that can be used for point-of-care, remote patient monitoring, and telehealth.</p><p>CEO Ben Park said the professional-grade diagnostic tool “improves patient care while reducing costs and is poised to revolutionize remote patient monitoring and telehealth through its unique ability to provide real-time patient vitals to healthcare providers.” He added “we are now entering partnerships with remote patient monitoring companies, hospital systems, home healthcare companies, and group purchasing organizations that help speed up our distribution and speed to market.”</p><h3><strong>Electronic medical record</strong>&nbsp;<strong>integration</strong></h3><p>According to the company, Vitals360 features a “generous” touchscreen and combines multiple biometric measurements in a single Android OS mobile device. The platform measures blood pressure, pulse, pulse oximetry, temperature, respiratory rate, and electrocardiography. Vitals360 collects vital signs as a stand-alone device or can communicate the readings to a cloud database using high-speed cellular data transmission, and can operate on most wireless carriers or over a Wi-Fi network.</p><p>VoCare added that it offers electronic medical record integration services via&nbsp;its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.firstwordhealthtech.com/story/5326215">partnership</a>&nbsp;with Harris Healthcare to load patient data coming from Vitals360.</p><p><a href="https://vocare.com/author/webmaster/">webmaster</a>2021-08-05T16:44:46-04:00&nbsp;</p>
