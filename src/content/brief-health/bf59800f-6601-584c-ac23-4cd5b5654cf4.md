Telemedicine allows you to discuss non-emergency medical issues with a doctor by phone or online at a time that’s convenient for you. Telemedicine offers access to licensed medical professionals for people who may not have access otherwise. It’s important to keep in mind that telemedicine healthcare professionals do not have the ability to take your blood or urine samples, heart rate, blood pressure, or other important medical tests. Plus, it’s a great option for people who may not otherwise have access to certain physicians or physician types, or who cannot afford, or prefer not to pay, the price of standard medical visits. Telemedicine is also a very accessible way to see a physician for certain purposes, like refilling a prescription or sharing preliminary information, checking symptoms, or bringing up concerns about a health issue that does not require a physical examination. While telemedicine makes appointments easier and more mobile, be careful not to take your appointment in public places, as privacy could be an issue. Ratings: We carefully considered customer reviews to find out what it’s really like to use these telemedicine companies.

Types of services offered: We looked for companies that can help with a variety of medical issues, and many also offer lab testing and mental health services. Accessibility: We considered how services and results are delivered - via phone call, video, apps, and more - and whether you’ll have access to 24/7 care. Here are 10 of the best telemedicine companies. Sesame Care providers are often less expensive than your health insurance copay. Pricing varies based on your insurance plan and your medical care needs. In addition to urgent care and general medical questions, Amwell also has a variety of other video medical services available.

LiveHealth’s offerings include allergy visits, in which you can map out a treatment plan and get a prescription if needed. Prescriptions can send prescriptions electronically to the pharmacy of your choice; offers short-term refills; does not provide controlled substances, Gabapentin (psychiatry can provide), muscle relaxants, lifestyle drugs (Viagra, Cialis), weight loss drugs, and medications containing ephedrine/pseudoephedrine. Prescriptions offers prescriptions for most common medical conditions (may include over-the-counter \[OTC\] or prescription medications), birth control, and emergency contraception; doesn’t prescribe or refill anxiety or depression medication, travel medications, smoking cessation medications, or controlled substances. 

How to choose the right telemedicine company for your needs For example, if you have a specific health condition or communication style preference, look into telemedicine companies that have experience with similar ailments or work in the way you want. You should also consider whether you’re likely to need lab work or prescriptions, and ensure the company or medical professional you’re considering can arrange for those. Maybe you need a company that can provide documentation for your health insurance reimbursement, or maybe you prefer to pay by debit. Telemedicine should not be used in place of an in-person doctor visit. provide mental health services Many telemedicine services accept insurance plans from major providers, but one benefit of telemedicine is that most services are made to be cost-effective for people who do not have insurance. Both telemedicine and telehealth refer to services that are offered via phone or video compared to in-person services. Telemedicine specifically refers to digital clinical healthcare services. Telehealth can include services such as training for healthcare professionals and medical education, as well as other non-clinical services and information. If you’re looking to save money on healthcare expenses, or you do not have health insurance, there are some low cost and free health services available. If you’re looking for a pregnancy test, birth control, or services related to sexual health, Planned Parenthood offers many discounted and free services. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration offers a confidential free service for anyone needing assistance regarding substance and mental health issues. Some of the telehealth services mentioned above can be free with insurance, like Teledoc and LiveHealth Online.
