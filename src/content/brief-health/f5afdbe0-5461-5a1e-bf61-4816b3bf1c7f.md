<p>The platform was built at Redesign Health with March of Dimes' Innovation Fund contributing to its seed round. With a $4.5 million seed investment, the women's healthcare platform Iron Health was founded, enabling obstetricians and gynaecologists to connect their patients with primary and other specialist care. The September-launched Innovation Fund of the March of Dimes made a seed investment in Iron Health and is a strategic partner and investor. The New York City An OB/practice GYN's can virtually expand into Iron Health, a women's health platform that uses technology to connect primary and specialised care, support coordinated care, and provide online services. The website gives patients access to an OB/GYN Iron Health team member, such as nurse practitioners, qualified dieticians, clinical social workers, and registered nurses, as well as virtual visits, direct messaging, and other services. Redesign Health, a business that creates, releases, and finds products, designed the platform.</p>
