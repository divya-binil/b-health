<p>Dr. Liz Kwo breaks down the data and technology-enabled healthcare tools being adopted by next-generation payers and providers.</p><p>COVID-19 has reshaped the way humans interact with technology in healthcare. Many countries have responded with public health measures such as social distancing, masks, and quarantine for suspected and confirmed cases.&nbsp;Intelligent data, technology, artificial intelligence (AI)&nbsp;and machine learning (ML) have&nbsp;started to lighten the burden to establish new ways for both health system supply and demand sustainability.</p><p>Among the most visible promoters of digital health are&nbsp;next-generation payers and providers (NGPPs). These companies, many of them created after implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), have commonly adopted the belief that technology is the solution to improving the healthcare system. Their focus is on delivering technology-enabled solutions to improve clients, such as employers' – but more importantly, patients' as the end-user's –&nbsp;experiences. These companies are using concepts such as blockchain, telehealth, web applications and genomics.</p><p><a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/how-intelligent-data-transforms-health-time-covid">Read on mobihealthnews.com</a></p>
