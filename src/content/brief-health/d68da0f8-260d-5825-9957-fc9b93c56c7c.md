<p>The healthcare industry is changing in a number of ways as artificial intelligence (AI) has in other sectors. Global health systems could become faster, more effective, and more efficient thanks to artificial intelligence. The growth in patient data sets and the demand for more affordable healthcare will be the main drivers of artificial intelligence's global revenue in the healthcare sector. AI has revolutionised a number of healthcare-related applications, including imaging, patient risk assessment, medication discovery, and diagnostics, to mention a few. The development of the sector is also being changed by recent AI in healthcare developments including drug design, data mining, and surgical robots.</p>
