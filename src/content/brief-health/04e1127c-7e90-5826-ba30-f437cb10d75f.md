<p>The physician clinical systems leader at Galileo highlights the operations of virtual care in 50 states and explains how bilingual services can improve health equity.
Galileo is a recently launched telehealth service that delivers 24/7 primary and multi-specialty care in both English and Spanish.
More than 85% of patients report improved health after receiving care from Galileo.
Galileo first launched with in-home care for Medicare and Medicaid patients, creating a framework to include social determinants of health in clinical analysis and to bridge gaps in healthcare education.
 Galileo's Spanish-language offering stems from our commitment to provide equitable healthcare to all. By creating and delivering the fully bilingual healthcare platform offering 24/7 care in both English and Spanish, we are removing a key barrier to care.
It's also important to meet people where they are, which is why in addition to virtual care services, Galileo offers bilingual and bicultural home and community-based care.
We have trained clinicians who understand the cultural nuances when providing care to Spanish-speaking communities.
To access Galileo's 24/7 on-demand digital care platform, patients simply use the app in Spanish.
"It gave me a great deal of personal satisfaction to be able to help this Spanish-speaking patient, and this is something that we pride ourselves on at Galileo â€“ offering seamless, culturally sensitive care."</p>
