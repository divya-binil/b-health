<p>According to a report by Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of the Mid-Atlantic States, Inc., unauthorised access to its electronic health record system may have given away patient information for more than 8,500 people. On September 21, 2022, Kaiser Permanente found that one of its employees had improperly and without a valid purpose accessed portions of patient medical records for the Mid-Atlantic area. The healthcare company made a statement on its website stating that "an inquiry concluded that the former employee's access was outside the scope of their allowed job functions." There is no proof that the obtained material, which included patient demographics and medical information, including images, was shared or used to perpetrate fraud, despite the fact that no social security numbers or financial information were involved in this event.</p>
