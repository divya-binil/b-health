<p>In the first installment of Healthcare IT News' newest feature series, five hospital and health system IT leaders describe how and where they're planning to spend on artificial intelligence and machine learning.<br><br>While the pandemic is still raging, the chaos of the past 18 months has calmed a bit, and the dust is starting to settle. Now the time has come for healthcare CIOs and other health IT leaders to look forward and plan their IT investments â€“ shaped, in no small part, by the lessons of the recent past.</p><p>According to new research from HIMSS Media, the average overall 2021 IT budget is nearly $13 million, with 15% on average being allocated to IT security. While that may be a lot of money, there are many technological areas yearning for more investment.</p><p>Today, <i>Healthcare IT News</i> launches a new feature article series, Health IT Investment: The Next Five Years.</p><p>We speak with health IT leaders, primarily CIOs, to learn&nbsp;the path forward through the priorities they set with their investments in six categories: AI and machine learning; interoperability; telehealth, connected health and remote patient monitoring; cybersecurity; electronic health records and population health; emerging technology; and other systems.</p>
