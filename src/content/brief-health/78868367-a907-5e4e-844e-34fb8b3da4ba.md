<p>The roll-out of new robot technology, developed by telemedicine provider Consultant Connect, is helping to ease pressures on hospitals during Covid-19.
They enable specialist consultants to see, hear and speak with patients as if they were at their bedside, even if they are miles away at a different hospital or at home shielding with Covid symptoms.
Dr Steve Jackson, consultant physician and chief medical information officer at University Hospitals of Leicester, said: “With the telemedicine devices I can be doing a ward round on one site in the morning and have a clinic booked immediately afterwards in the afternoon at another.
After the overwhelming success of Consultant Connect’s devices in Liverpool and Leicester, more hospitals in England and Scotland plan to adopt the technology in 2022.</p>
