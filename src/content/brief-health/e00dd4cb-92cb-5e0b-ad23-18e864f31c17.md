<p>To improve the quality of care and foster a safe environment for patients, it is crucial for nurses and physicians to work together effectively. With staffing shortages and increased burnout rates, however, the nurse-physician dynamic is under threat. To set both nurses and physicians up for success, hospitals should implement structured training, use technology to streamline communication and staffing, and work on tackling staffing shortages. A solid nurse-physician interaction is essential to attaining positive patient outcomes, as anybody working in the healthcare industry is aware of. A clinical team that understands how to work together to accomplish that aim is necessary to deliver high-quality care. It will be quite challenging to keep the patient safe if we don't know how to collaborate or how to coordinate our treatment. The majority of one-on-one time with patients during treatment is spent by nurses, who also play a crucial part in preparing future doctors to practise. When I think back on my time as a resident, I frequently remember a particularly tense day during a code when a senior nurse stood by me the entire time.</p>
