<p>The editors of Healthcare Finance News consider how much has changed in the last year and what it means for trends in 2023 as 2022 comes to a close. The popularity of home health and telehealth is in jeopardy because the public health emergency is still in effect and will do so through January 11, 2023. Hospital utilisation continues to climb, this time due to a confluence of COVID-19, the flu, and the respiratory syncytial virus. CEOs and CFOs continue to balance finances, inflation, rising labour costs, shortages, and the need to decide whether to invest in digital health, AI, and automation. And as usual, there is a rising demand for transparent pricing structures and interoperable systems.</p>
