<p>Clanton, Ala.-based Ascension St. Vincent’s Chilton announced a new partnership with the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Medicine the partnership will bring a tele-critical care unit and tele-stroke unit to the residents of Chilton County. The partnership will bring a tele-critical care unit and tele-stroke unit to the residents of Chilton County. The new initiatives will allow patients to receive care closer to their homes without compromising the quality of care they receive. From the operations center, UAB specialists will connect via video into hospital rooms to conduct remote exams of patients and work with Ascension St. Vincent’s care teams to develop a treatment plan.”
That said, “The tele-critical care program will support Ascension St. Vincent’s Chilton hospitalists by allowing them to easily consult with intensivists at UAB.
If a patient goes to Ascension St. Vincent’s Chilton emergency department presenting symptoms of a stroke, the team will use the tele-stroke program to request an “on-demand stroke consult.” Then, one of UAB’s neurologists will assess the patient with the help of an on-site emergency room physician or nurse.</p>
