<p>In order to encourage patients to register to use your online patient engagement portal and to continue using it over time, your practice must focus on these key components: preparation, outreach, and encouragement.
Before you can begin marketing the patient engagement portal to patients, your office and clinical staff must fully understand the portal: not only how to use it but also why it is important for patients to use it.</p><p>One way to effectively market the patient engagement portal is for office staff to inform patients as they come in for an appointment.
If your practice has a website, consider creating a landing page where clients can locate all of the information regarding the patient engagement portal, including the link to get started.</p>
