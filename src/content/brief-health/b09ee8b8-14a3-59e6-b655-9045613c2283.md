<p>Implicity®, a leader in remote patient monitoring and cardiac data management solutions, announced its continued growth with the appointment of two new senior-level executives.
Both Vanessa and Megan bring a wealth of industry knowledge to support our rapid global expansion, particularly in the U.S. where we see a dramatic rise in remote patient monitoring," said Dr. Arnaud Rosier, Electrophysiologist, CEO, and Co-founder of Implicity.
To help communicate the unique benefits of Implicity's automated cardiac remote monitoring platform, Megan Grosz is joining Implicity as Head of Global Marketing and Communications.
The Implicity platform aggregates, normalizes, and standardizes data from all implantable cardiac electronic devices across all major manufacturers - and improves care for patients with chronic heart failure conditions.</p>
