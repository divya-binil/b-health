<p>Digital health, digital pills, digital therapeutics… With the ‘digital’ suffix being increasingly used in the digital health industry, the meaning behind some terms might not be so evident at a glance. For instance, one might think that ‘digital therapeutics’ and ‘digital pills’ are interchangeable terms; but they are in fact totally different digital health tools.</p><p>While we <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/the-present-and-future-of-digital-pills/">discussed digital pills in depth</a> last year, we have yet to talk about digital therapeutics. And this is exactly what we have set out to do with this article; as the latter might very well be a viable option in your future treatment.</p>
