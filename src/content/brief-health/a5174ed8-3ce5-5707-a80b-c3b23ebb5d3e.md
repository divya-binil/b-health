<p>The <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/coronavirus-covid-19/">COVID-19</a> pandemic, which has taken<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days"> 270,000</a> American lives to date, has shined a light on another crisis — the U.S. currently has no standardized system for reporting public health data. Health departments all over the country resort to using paper, fax, phone, and email to transmit and receive critical information, and essential healthcare workers are spending precious time retyping data into systems from printed reports and PDFs.</p><p>At the heart of this lack of a centralized infrastructure for reporting public health data is the<a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-x"> 10th Amendment</a> of the U.S. Constitution, which says, <i>“The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”</i> Because of this amendment, the federal government — including the CDC — is not able to mandate that states, providers, or public health entities use a centralized reporting mechanism for managing all public health data. Further, the 10th Amendment also allows states to set up their own IT systems independently of other states and the federal government. The CDC then has to beg for data that sits in bespoke, disparate information systems in each state and<i> </i>territory.</p>
