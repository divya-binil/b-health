<p>Together by Renee is the first app to employ generative AI to accomplish and manage time-consuming healthcare activities for ageing folks, people with chronic conditions, and their overworked carers. It was developed by Dr. Renee Dua and Nick Desai, who previously created and built doctor house call firm Heal. Together eliminates the various barriers — including prescription refills, appointment scheduling, complicated forms, opaque insurance coverage, and more — that prevent Americans over 50 from achieving improved health outcomes without the need for typing or data entry by "magically" doing away with them using just the smartphone camera and AI.</p><p>Together, a breakthrough in convenience, is the first American app to monitor vitals including blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, and blood oxygen simply by asking users to smile for a picture.</p>
