<p>While IoMT devices offer healthcare providers new means of delivering care, healthcare management groups must address the vast security challenges presented by IoMT.
Below, you’ll find 10 of the best ways to secure your organization’s IoMT devices.
At present, many IoMT devices on healthcare or hospital networks operate as shadow IT; invisible to network administrators or security professionals.
Once devices are visible, organizations must take inventory, helping to determine which types of endpoints need cyber security protection, and what kind of protection the organization should pursue.
As appropriate, depending on the nature of the equipment, healthcare groups might want to patch devices with a security overlay that relies on network IPS, allowing “virtual patching” of vulnerable equipment.
Organizations should take care in selecting IoMT security policies and enforcement mechanisms.
Consider adding a zero-trust security overlay to your network, which will allow you to improve the management of IoMT network access controls, and lead to cyber risk reduction.
Selecting a security vendor who can cover all of your hospital or healthcare system’s security needs makes cyber security management easier and more efficient than working with a variety of vendors.
Information Technology professionals who would like to offer healthcare providers cyber security training must reflect on how they can align themselves with staff.
While securing IoMT remains a continuous challenge for Information Technology teams, strong foundational cyber security strategies and solutions can empower your organization to stop threats.</p>
