<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. It causes the body’s immune system to attack the different parts of the central nervous system such as the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. While there is no cure for MS, stem cell therapy can help improve a person’s symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. Stem cell therapy is an experimental treatment that people can access through clinical trials.</p><p><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/37556">MS</a> causes the body to <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Multiple-Sclerosis-Information-Page#disorders-r1">direct an immune responseTrusted Source</a> to its own central nervous system.</p><p>This immune response <a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Definition-of-MS">damages the myelin</a>, which is the fatty substance that surrounds the nerve fibers.
