<p>A novel VR therapy for psychological symptoms in patients with PBT (primary brain tumors) was analyzed in the interim analysis of a research published in the Journal for Neuro-Oncology. The researchers proposed the possibility and patient acceptance of a VR intervention. Twenty individuals finished the study and received VR headsets with different scenarios preinstalled. Nearly all participants reported frequent usage and great pleasure after experiencing VR for a month. The National Cancer Institute (NCI), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and AppliedVR collaborated on a phase 2 clinical trial investigation that was conducted today. AppliedVR is an innovator in immersive therapeutics (ITx), pushing a revolutionary approach to medicine. In the phase 2 clinical trial, it was investigated whether VR might be used as a primary brain intervention.</p>
