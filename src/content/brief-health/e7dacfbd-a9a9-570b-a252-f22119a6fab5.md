<p>Dr. Nadia Chaudhri, a neuroscientist and professor, shared her experience with ovarian cancer on Twitter, showing how social media can be a powerful tool to connect and educate on chronic or serious illnesses.<br><br>Scrolling through Dr. Nadia Chaudhri’s <a href="https://twitter.com/DrNadiaChaudhri">Twitter feed</a>, her more than 150,000 followers could see a small window of her life with terminal ovarian cancer: a sun-lit photo of her son eating a mango, a funny tweet about the heart-shaped sticker used to prevent bedsores, the <a href="https://twitter.com/DrNadiaChaudhri/status/1437518784361816067">much-retweeted</a> thread from September chronicling her symptoms and eventual diagnosis.&nbsp;</p><p>Chaudhri, a neuroscientist and professor at Concordia University in Canada, <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/cunews/offices/advancement/2021/10/06/she-was-a-force-of-nature-nadia-chaudhri-1978-2021-passes-away.html">passed away last week</a> at the age of 43, leaving behind a community inspired by her candid discussion of her experience with a terminal cancer diagnosis and her push to spread awareness so others could recognize their symptoms early.</p><p>“Know your bodies. Pay attention to fatigue and changes in bowel/urinary tract movements. Make sure you understand all the words on a medical report. Do not dismiss your pain or malaise. Find the expert doctors,” she wrote.</p>
