<p>What does the hospital of the future look like? That depends on how health system and hospital executives apply the knowledge learned during the COVID-19 crisis to their strategic plans moving forward, according to Michael J. Dowling, CEO and president Northwell Health.&nbsp;</p><p>Dowling gave the HIMSS21 Digital Visionary<a href="https://www.himss.org/global-conference/session-visionary-keynote-leading-future"> Keynote:</a> Leading for the Future, Tuesday, August 10, during the HIMSS21 Digital conference.<br>&nbsp;<br>Over the past 15 months, everyone has emerged from an extraordinary experience and no one was spared, Dowling said. The outcome for too many was disastrous and deadly.</p><p>"We were at war with an invisible enemy," he said. "Over the past 15 months that we could not touch and could not feel. It tested us and it changed our normal way of living."</p><p>The pandemic, which continues with the spread of the Delta and other variants, highlighted the ability of health systems to be agile and respond quickly during a crisis, when regulations are relaxed as they were when the pandemic began.</p>
