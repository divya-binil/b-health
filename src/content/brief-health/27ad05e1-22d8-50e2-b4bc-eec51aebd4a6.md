Expanding access to quality care and responding to increasing patient demand, the London GP at Hand clinics open their doors with a variety of NHS clinicians, practice nurses and Health Care Assistants to provide customised in-person care.</p>  <p dir="ltr">Located within the heart of Victoria and St James, Dean Farrar Street, opened its doors last week to GP at Hand patients. Fitted with state-of-the-art equipment for in-clinic and digital consultations, the upgraded clinic provides patients with more space, appointment availability and a variety of clinician types. Following the opening of Dean Farrar Street, the next clinic to open will be Drummond Street, in Euston, London, next month. Both clinics will host a bright and airy space, along with opening hours from 08.00 - 20.00 Monday - Friday and 09.00 - 18.00 Saturday.</p>  <p dir="ltr">Dr Matthew Noble, Babylon’s UK Medical Director said: “In-person care is so important alongside highly-accessible digital appointments and we are really excited to launch these two new clinics for our Babylon GP at Hand patients in London. We’ve seen a rise in the number of appointments and we are responding to this demand by opening two new clinics in convenient locations that will increase access to quality care when needed, while helping to minimise unnecessary GP visits, receive personalised attention as needed, and provide dedicated clinician time for the patients that need them most”.</p> <p dir="ltr">Babylon GP at Hand is digital-first, meaning that all patients must have a digital appointment before potentially being invited in for a face-to-face appointment, with exceptions where patients will be invited to the clinic for flu jabs, smear tests etc. </p> <p dir="ltr">Since November 2017 over 113,000 people across London and Birmingham have registered with Babylon GP at Hand. This mix of virtual and in person care has been proven to relieve the UK’s overstretched healthcare system, with <a href="https://www.babylonhealth.com/press/peer-reviewed-research-finds-babylons-digital-first-model-of-primary-care-is-associated-with-lower-significantly-nhs-hospital-care-costs">peer-reviewed research</a> finding that Babylon’s partnership with the NHS reduced A&amp;E attendance by 25% after members joined the service, and acute hospital costs were between 15-35% less than the regional average. By combining virtual services with in-person care at the Westminster and Euston GP at Hand clinics, Babylon is re-engineering how people engage with their care at every step of the healthcare continuum. Babylon has already shown that in environments as diverse as the developed UK or developing Rwanda, urban New York or rural Missouri, for children on Medicaid, or the elderly on Medicare, it is possible to achieve its mission by leveraging its highly scalable, digital-first platform combined with high quality, virtual clinical operations to provide integrated, personalised healthcare. </p>  <p dir="ltr"><strong>About Babylon</strong></p>  <p dir="ltr">Babylon is one of the world’s fastest growing digital healthcare companies whose mission is to make high-quality healthcare accessible and affordable for every person on Earth.
