The Trump administration released a final rule to require hospitals to publish payer-negotiated prices and a proposal to mandate insurers post online real-time cost-sharing information.Â 

The final rule gives hospitals more time to post payer-negotiated rates. The original proposed rule, released as part of the hospital outpatient payment rule, required hospitals to post prices starting in 2020.
