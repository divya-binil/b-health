<p>A team of strategists, data scientists, engineers, and solutions architects will work closely with customers to develop customized solutions that take use of generative AI at the AWS Generative AI Innovation Centre. Companies in the healthcare and life sciences sector, for instance, can look for ways to speed up drug discovery and research. Financial services businesses may create ways to offer customers more individualized information and guidance, while manufacturers can construct solutions to reimagine industrial design and processes. AWS will assist clients in imagining and scoping the use cases that will add the most value to their companies through free workshops, engagements, and training, based on industry best practises.&nbsp;</p>
