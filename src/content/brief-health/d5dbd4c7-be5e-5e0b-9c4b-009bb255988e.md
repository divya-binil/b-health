<p>5 revenue cycle management trends that will drive adoption of automation, data-first processes, employee effectiveness and virtualization</p><p>Many physician practices are facing a harsh reality as they enter 2022: The <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/revenue-cycle-management/">revenue cycle processes</a> and technology that have traditionally produced an acceptable bottom line are no longer delivering.&nbsp;</p><p>Tectonic shifts in the way healthcare organizations are reimbursed are unearthing the shortfalls of reactive systems that don’t get ahead of claims issues, denials management and the rapidly growing bad debt associated with patient responsible balances.&nbsp;</p><p>And the primary culprit? Access to the kind of structured data that can help providers move from basic intelligence to effective intelligence—a model that enables users to execute tasks more effectively and measure the financial outcomes of work effort. Going deeper, providers need to have real-time visibility into their effective intelligence quotient— the effectiveness and bottom-line impact of each revenue cycle team member. Simply put, practices need to answer the questions: “Are staff leaving money on the table?” and “Who are my most effective team members?”</p><p>This depth of understanding comes from having an advanced infrastructure supported by algorithms that comb through data in real-time and support more effective workflows—a model that goes beyond access to data that drives productivity alone.</p>
