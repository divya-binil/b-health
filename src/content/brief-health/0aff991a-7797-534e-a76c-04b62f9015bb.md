<p>Phones, tablets, connected medical devices and other technologies provide a side door for hackers to infiltrate networks.
With many devices using outmoded operating systems, patients face a unique vulnerability, because a hacker could interfere with treatment.
Goings discussed the risks inherent in the Internet of Things, whether hackers can get in through implantable and similar devices, and what needs to happen to ensure security is maintained.
Medical device makers are trying to do the right thing when it comes to allowing doctors to adjust the function of devices via an app, rather than resorting to a new surgery to implant a new device.
The questions would certainly tie to the motive of targeting patients, but the question remains about what sort of risk or liability would be borne on the makers of the medical devices.
Q. You have said upgrading the security of IoT devices could require an entirely new FDA approval.
A. Medical device-makers have been taking a wait-and-see approach to addressing security.
Device updates or upgrades provide an opportunity to build security features into the design of connected devices as they undergo clinical trials.
The risk confronting healthcare providers is a bit different than what a device-maker faces, but a patient's attorney may attempt to include a hospital in a suit if it is determined that the hacker infiltrated the device through their IT systems.
Q. What are a couple of ways healthcare provider organization CISOs and CIOs can take action today to protect their IoT devices?
If devices cannot have endpoint security, then providers need to isolate the devices to a separate network that has tighter security.</p>
