Instead of hiring a team of agents to manually sort through and tag tickets according to topic or urgency, then route them to the team members most qualified to deal with them, businesses can opt for an intelligent automation solution – you’ve guessed it, automated ticket triaging!

Automated ticket triaging involves evaluating and directing support tickets to the right person, quickly and effectively, and even sorting tickets in order of importance, topic or urgency. So, manual triage but automatic. How does it work? Powered by machine learning, automatic triage functions in real time, making it more efficient than manual triage, plus it’s faster, more accurate, and easy to roll out across your business.

Automatic ticket triage can also be supported by triggers; actions that happen when preset conditions have been met.
