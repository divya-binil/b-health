<p>As the interoperability standard HL7 format has evolved over the years, its use has opened up to current web practices such as HTML, XML and JSON.</p><p>This has led to the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard which broadens the field of possibilities with its library of open source resources.</p><p>FHIR is seen to be one way to help boost interoperability in healthcare and is defined as a standard describing data formats and elements (known as “resources”) and an application programming interface (API) for exchanging electronic health records (EHR).</p><p>Benefits can include making data sharing easier, it can be fast to implement and it is vendor-neutral.</p><p>To understand how and why the FHIR standard came into being, Frédéric Laurent, project manager at Enovacom, reflects on the origins of this interoperability standard.</p><p>This white paper outlines everything you need to know about HL7 FHIR.</p><p>Find out more below.<br>&nbsp;</p>
