<p>Various versions of Hospital Information system (HIS) have been developed and implemented in Malaysian government hospitals as an enabler in providing a better service to public.However, some of the applications are suffering and facing many challenges during implementation phase and failed to be implemented successfully.Preliminary study revealed that there is no guideline in implementing IS in government hospitals in Northern Region of Malaysia.This article proposes a guideline to prevent the mentioned problems in ensuring a success implementation of IS in Malaysian government hospitals.Extensive literature review and in-depth interview have been conducted to identify the Critical Failure Factors (CFFs) of IS projects implementation.Key persons representing top management, IT practitioners and medical practitioners from four selected government hospitals in the Northern Region of Malaysia were involved in data collection.The model has been constructed to tackle the identified CFFs by incorporating the elements of CM adopted from the three CM models (Lewin’s, Kotter’s, and Prosci’s ADKAR models).The model is believed to be beneficial for top management, IT practitioners and medical practitioners in preventing IS implementation failure among government hospitals towards ensuring the success implementation.</p>
