<p>According to the alert, a growing number of vulnerabilities are caused by unpatched medical devices that run on outdated software and devices are missing sufficient security features.
Not only is outdated software a threat to medical devices, but many devices also have vulnerabilities including devices used with the default configuration, devices with customized software, and devices that werenâ€™t designed with security in mind.
According to a research report in 2021, a cybersecurity firm assessed there is an average of 6.2 vulnerabilities per medical device, and recalls were issued for critical devices such as pacemakers and insulin pumps with known security issues, while more than 40% of medical devices at the end-of-life stage offer little to no security patches or upgrades.</p>
