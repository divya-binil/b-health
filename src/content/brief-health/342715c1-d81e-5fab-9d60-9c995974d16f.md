<p>On Monday, Salesforce announced multiple updates for <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/health-cloud/overview/">Health Cloud</a>, the software-as-a-service company's industry-specific cloud for healthcare and life sciences organizations. These updates are being announced the same week as the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society's <a href="https://www.himss.org/global-conference">HIMSS21</a> conference in Las Vegas. Dr. Geeta Nayyar, Salesforce's Executive Medical Director and General Manager of Healthcare and Life Sciences, will be delivering a keynote at the event.</p><p>This year, Salesforce has launched new healthcare-related products as well as updating existing ones. In January, it launched <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/salesforce-launches-vaccine-cloud-to-help-public-sector-and-businesses-manage-covid-19-vaccinations/">Vaccine Cloud</a> to help public sector and businesses manage COVID-19 vaccinations. In April, the company updated Vaccine Cloud to <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/salesforce-updates-vaccine-cloud-to-help-healthcare-providers-manage-millions-of-appointments-a-day/">improve vaccination appointment scheduling</a> . The latest updates to Health Cloud continues that trend.</p><p>"For years, the healthcare system has struggled to catch up with the innovation we were seeing across other industries, but the pandemic forced us to accelerate digital transformation and provide the healthcare system with digital-first, always-on and patient-focused solutions" said Kevin Riley, SVP and GM of Healthcare and Life Sciences at Salesforce, in a <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/new-salesforce-care-from-anywhere/">press release</a>. "These new care from anywhere innovations ensure that we continue this digital transformation in healthcare and empower providers, payers, care coordinators and pharmaceutical companies to deliver care for patients wherever they are."</p>
