<p>Teleflex Incorporated (NYSE: TFX), a leading global provider of medical technologies, today announced a new agreement with FundamentalVR, a world leader in virtual reality (VR) integration for medical simulation.
The agreement will provide Teleflex with a VR training platform to accelerate the effective use of the company’s UroLift® 2 System, an innovative technology for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), commonly known as enlarged prostate.
The VR training platform integrates tactile feedback and a digital representation of the UroLift® 2 System to provide urologists with a “hands-on” VR experience that can accelerate their learning.
By leveraging the capabilities of FundamentalVR’s Fundamental Surgery platform, Teleflex aims to increase access and standardization of clinical training of the UroLift® 2 System in the United States and around the world, including Japan, where the UroLift® 2 System was recently approved for use. Teleflex showcased the Fundamental Surgery platform at the company’s UroLift® System booth at the 2022 American Urological Association (AUA) meeting in New Orleans.
“We are delighted to offer our customers this leading VR platform for surgical and procedural education which offers advanced, realistic graphics to help demonstrate the ease of use of the UroLift® 2 System in a variety of prostate anatomies,” said Kevin Hardage, President and General Manager of Teleflex Interventional Urology.</p>
