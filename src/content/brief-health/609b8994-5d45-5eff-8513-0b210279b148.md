<p>A recent analyst note from the Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center warned the healthcare sector about artificial intelligence and its potential to assist with malware development AI could customize attacks against the healthcare sector. An analyst note titled "Artificial Intelligence and Its Current Potential to Aid in Malware Development" was released by the Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3). The memo claims that artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved to the point that threat actors may now use it to create malware and phishing lures. According to the memo, "While the usage of AI is still quite limited and requires a smart user to make it successful, there will be a big paradigm shift in the development of malware once this technology becomes more user-friendly. The potential of a threat actor to use AI to swiftly and readily personalise assaults against the healthcare sector is one of the main elements that makes AI particularly risky for the industry.</p>
