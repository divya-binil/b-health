Since HIPAA, electronic health records (EHR) and electronic medical records (EMR) continue transforming the way patient medical data is recorded and stored. As Internet of Things (IoT) devices become more prevalent in health care, many of them still lack integration with EHR and EMR, creating gaps between the creation of those records and their housing in hospital networks. In this guest post, Eric Dusseux, MD, MSc, MBA, CEO of a robotics company focused on providing rehabilitation and mobility solutions to individuals with neurological and mobility challenges, explains what needs to be done to close these gaps and increase the accuracy of decisions and availability of patient records.
