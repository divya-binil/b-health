<p>Spurred by COVID-19, we are witnessing the unprecedented digital transformation of health care, and hospitals and health systems that don’t rapidly innovate to meet this “new normal” risk being left behind. Health care organizations must tailor their strategies to win consumer loyalty while delivering differentiated value.</p><p>Digital makes these shifts possible, and hospitals and health systems must move from “doing digital” to “being digital” to compete in a rapidly evolving market. AVIA, a leading digital transformation partner for health systems, designed the <a href="https://aviahealth.com/insights/the-4-big-moves-to-emerge-stronger-a-playbook-to-being-digital-in-healthcare-white-paper/?utm_source=referral&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=medical-economics">“4 big moves”</a> to provide a road map for hospitals and health systems looking to embrace digital and emerge as leaders in health care.</p><h2><strong>Big Move #1: Own the On-ramp</strong></h2><p>AVIA’s first big move, “own the on-ramp,” encourages health care organizations to create a flexible supply and demand model. In this model, consumer demand is the driving force. To create a digital-focused on-ramp, consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Building out the digital front door.</strong> Create an integrated digital access point, with capabilities to digitally search for and schedule an appointment, virtually triage symptoms, navigate to the right site of care and access on-demand virtual visits. These capabilities can be provided through chat, text, voice or a hospital’s website or app.</li><li><strong>Envision the digital front door as a marketplace.</strong>This approach might include dynamic pricing for expiring inventory, merchandising to third-party sites, transparency of services and pricing, and convenient payments.</li></ul><p>Owning the on-ramp allows hospitals and health systems to improve convenience and optionality for patients and families across their care journey.</p>
