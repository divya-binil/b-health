<p>Brave Health, a virtual-first behavioral health provider focused on serving Medicaid populations, today announced an innovative referral partnership with MedArrive, the mobile-integrated care management platform company.
Through this collaboration, if MedArrive identifies an eligible health plan member in need of mental health support, MedArrive's field providers can immediately refer that member to Brave Health's behavioral health providers in real time and schedule care within days. MedArrive's field provider network of highly trained, skilled paramedics, EMTs, and other healthcare professionals deliver a mix of in-home health care services, diagnostics, health assessments, and other important preventive health measures.
Field providers and case management teams also identify care gaps and help members address social needs, including transportation, nutrition, behavioral health needs, and mobility challenges.
Both MedArrive and Brave Health provide critical healthcare services that help individuals overcome barriers to engagement, and now with an established integration, the two healthcare leaders can help health plans better coordinate more comprehensive care while potentially lowering costs.</p>
