title: Global EHR market hits $31B but faces usability, interoperability challenges
---

The worldwide electronic health records market faces intensifying criticism related to usability and interoperability as well as slowing growth due to market saturation.

Despite these challenges, the EHR market topped $31.5 billion in 2018, according to a report from market research firm Kalorama Information.

The market for EHRs, which includes revenues for EHR systems, computerized provider order entry systems, and directly related services, such as installation, training, servicing, and consulting, grew 6% from $29.7 billion the previous year, the report said.
