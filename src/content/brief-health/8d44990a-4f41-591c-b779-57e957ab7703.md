The new partnership, focused on social determinants of health, aims to create a statewide mechanism for sharing data referrals, interventions and outcomes among providers and social care agencies.

The partnership is expected to equip participating Michigan hospitals with unprecedented context on emergency department patients at the point of care, according to the collaborators&#39; initial pledge.Â 

Having information when a patient arrives at the emergency room is a barrier to coordinated care and improving outcomes. The data silos of public health that are disconnected from state health exchanges became glaringly apparent during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with the lack of interoperability between the Centers for Disease Control and the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.
