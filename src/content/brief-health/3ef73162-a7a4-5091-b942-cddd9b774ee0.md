<p>Innovaccer Inc., the Health Cloud company, announced today that Adventist HealthCare has selected Innovaccer to be their next-generation population health management and value-based care partner.
The not-for-profit health services organization, based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, was looking to create a unified data platform to help deliver high-quality care to their community and accelerate its mission to transform healthcare through a holistic care model.
Value-based care and population health management are increasingly integral to enhancing the patient experience, and to developing successful future healthcare technology solutions. “Our goal is to focus on innovative ways to enhance the comprehensive patient journey, from building health awareness in our community to providing comprehensive care and maintaining total well-being,” says Chris Ghion, CIO of Adventist HealthCare.
The Innovaccer® Health Cloud unifies patient data across systems and care settings, and empowers healthcare organizations to develop scalable, modern applications that improve clinical, financial, and operational outcomes.</p>
