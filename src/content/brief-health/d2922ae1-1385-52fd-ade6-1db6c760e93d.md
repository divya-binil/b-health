<p>Since I was six years old and my parents purchased the first 286 IBM computer in the early 1980s, I have been a huge technology nerd. I can vividly recall learning how to type and play games. Wow, how things have evolved. Early in my boyhood, I enjoyed watching open-heart surgery while eating Cheerios in front of my large wooden television. Early on, I always wanted to be a doctor, but I soon saw that my computer skills far outweighed my understanding of medicine. As a result, I made the decision to mix the two and create solutions for my colleagues who worked in the healthcare industry. What, in my opinion, will be the most important healthcare technology in 2023 and beyond? Get motivated by reading more.</p>
