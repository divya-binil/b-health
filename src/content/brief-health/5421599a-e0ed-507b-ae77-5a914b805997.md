<p>Social media boosts patient volume while keeping practitioners abreast of trends: 81% of medical professionals use social media to keep up with new medical developments by following other professionals. Practices market their businesses on a variety of social media platforms: The three platforms with the greatest users among providers are Facebook (67%), Instagram (63%), and LinkedIn (46%). Medical professionals divide their personal and professional finances: 62% of healthcare workers advertise their medical practice and themselves as professionals on social media. However, 69% have accounts for both their work and personal lives that never mention one. Each practice and person creates content differently: The majority (72%) of practitioners who publish on behalf of their entire practice include links to relevant news stories.&nbsp;</p>
