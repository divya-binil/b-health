<p>The new offering combines Reducept's VR game and XRHealth's technology.<br><br>XRHealth, maker of health-focused virtual and augmented reality tools, launched a new program designed to address pain management, as part of a partnership with ehealth company Reducept.</p><p>The new program will use a VR game designed by Reducept to help train a patient's brain to manage pain. The gamified experience offers targeted behavioral experiments and techniques to tackle pain, which are based on acceptance and commitment therapy, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy.</p><p>The program will run on XRHealth's VR technology, which allows patients to share their results in real time in order to adjust therapy. XRHealth's tech is also able to capture analytics over time.</p><p>"Virtual reality can provide a realistic and immersive experience for users to train their brain to gain control over their body and produce their own medication, potentially eliminating dependency on drugs while providing the much necessary alleviation from the pain," Eran Orr, CEO of XRHealth, said in a statement. &nbsp;</p><p>"Users feel empowered by the new-found control over their mind and the influence it has on their body."</p>
