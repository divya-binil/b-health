<p>If you’re not following what’s happening in the world of <a href="https://www.healthcareittoday.com/tag/remote-patient-monitoring/">remote patient monitoring (RPM)</a>, you should be.&nbsp; There are literally <a href="https://www.healthcareittoday.com/remote-patient-monitoring-rpm-companies/">hundreds of RPM companies</a> that are exploring a wide variety of ways you can approach RPM and chronic care management and many are showing really promising results.&nbsp; It’s not hard to see how these technologies and processes are the start of the future of how we want to experience healthcare.</p><p>That said, RPM and chronic care management are a very different way of thinking about how most healthcare organizations interact with patients.&nbsp; It’s a fundamental mindset shift from a 15 min doctor visit to remotely monitoring and engaging with a patient to help keep them healthy and/or direct them to the care that’s needed.</p><p>As we try to understand this evolution in healthcare, we sat down with&nbsp;Angie Stevens, RN BSN, Founder at <a href="https://www.healthlogx.com/">Health Logx</a>, and Julie Mann, Chief Commercial Officer at <a href="https://www.go.carium.com/">Carium</a>, to talk about their experience providing this care and the lessons they’ve learned to effectively do chronic disease management.&nbsp; They also share a number of success stories from Stevens’ experience working with patients remotely and how to effectively balance the mix of technology and human connection that’s needed to do RPM and chronic care management well.</p>
