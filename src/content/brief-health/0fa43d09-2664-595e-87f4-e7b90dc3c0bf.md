<p>Fewer women hold biomedical patents, leading to a reduced number of patented technologies designed to address problems affecting women, say researchers from McGill University, Harvard Business School, and the Universidad de Navarra in Barcelona.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Biases that limit the number of women in science and technology are well known, but the consequences in the labour market extend beyond the gender gap, according to a study published in&nbsp;<i>Science.</i>&nbsp;Investigators found that demographic inequities in who gets to invent lead to demographic inequities in who benefits from invention.</p><p>“Although the percentage of biomedical patents held by women has risen from 6.3% to 16.2% over the last three decades, men continue to significantly outnumber women as patent holders. As a result, health inventions have tended to focus more on the needs of men than women,” says co-author&nbsp;John-Paul Ferguson, an Associate Professor at McGill University.</p>
