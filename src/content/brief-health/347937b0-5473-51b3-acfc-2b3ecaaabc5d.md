<p>In just two and a half years, telehealth moved from being an afterthought on the list of services offered by the majority of healthcare providers to becoming an absolute necessity for millions of Americans. The Covid-19 outbreak caused us to reconsider how healthcare is provided, and almost instantly, telemedicine and the technologies that made it possible rose to the top of our list of most important healthcare infrastructure elements. However, it appears that many people have returned to viewing telehealth as an add-on rather than the primary service provided by a healthcare plan as the world has opened up again and life has returned to "normal." There are, of course, practical explanations for this going to your doctor's office is no longer problematic, hospitals are no longer concerned about crowding.</p>
