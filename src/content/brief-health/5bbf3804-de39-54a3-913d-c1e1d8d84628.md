<p>The HIMSS Executive Summit for the Middle East will bring together healthcare leaders 11 May 2023 in an exclusive setting at the Jumeirah Emirates Towers in Dubai to build relationships, address key challenges in care delivery and accelerate digital transformation through information and technology. An exclusive, high-level meeting for provider chief information officers, senior IT executives, and government representatives, the HIMSS Executive Summit &amp; Awards for the Middle East includes keynote addresses, panel discussions, and Q&amp;A sessions. The summit's theme, Digital Health Driving Greater Sustainability, reflects the fact that 2023 will be the United Arab Emirates' Year of Sustainability. This initiative aims to raise awareness of environmental sustainability by encouraging collective action through a national commitment to sustainable practises. The Ministry of Health and Prevention of the United Arab Emirates has given its support to the HIMSS Executive Summit &amp; Awards for the Middle East. According to Mitch Icenhower, chief relationship officer at HIMSS, "sustainability is a driving force for the global health industry with it at the top of many governments' agendas."</p>
