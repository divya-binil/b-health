<p>ModMed, a pioneer in healthcare technology, is happy to announce that the US Government has granted Patent No. 11,443,836 protecting some of the essential features of its EHR system. This system is intended to save clinicians time by automating the documentation of exams and free up more time for them to devote to the patient in front of them. Doctors are aware of their own needs. We create our product for the fields of expertise we work in. Each doctor customises their practise to the people they are seeing, and every speciality practises medicine in a unique way. Because EMA has the necessary medical knowledge out of the box for each specialty, less physician burnout results. Dan Cane, CEO and cofounder, remarked that this patent "solidifies our position in the EMR industry for physicians seeking technology designed to make their life easier."</p>
