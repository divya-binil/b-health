<p>Where should leaders in health security start? What should you keep away from? What are the best techniques? How do you maintain education? Former deputy division chief of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and Dark Cryptonite co-founder Tyler Cohen Wood has some solutions. Organizations that provide healthcare services are always the target of cyberattacks. The valuable patient information, which is worth considerably more than just a credit card number, is what the bad guys are pursuing. Because of this, healthcare CIOs, CISOs, and other security executives must inform the staff of their companies on the best defences against cyberattacks. But for this form of instruction to be effective, it must really penetrate through and settle in. Tyler Cohen Wood is the guest on this podcast.</p>
