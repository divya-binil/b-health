<p>The team found that that post-traumatic stress disorders and sexual assault trauma were associated with functional seizures.<br><br>Vanderbilt University Medical Center researchers used electronic medical record data to determine the prevalence of "functional seizures" and the comorbidities associated with them. &nbsp;</p><p>In a study published this past week in the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774486"><i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i></a>, the team found that post-traumatic stress disorders and sexual assault trauma were associated with functional seizures, or episodes that are similar to epileptic seizures in their clinical presentation but display no aberrant brain electrical patterns. Functional seizure patients face an average diagnostic delay of seven years. &nbsp;</p><p>"I felt like studies within electronic health records could potentially be really impactful for this community," said Lea Davis, who headed the team, to the <a href="https://news.vumc.org/2021/01/07/functional-seizures-prevalence-comorbidities/"><i>VUMC Reporter</i></a>. &nbsp;</p>
