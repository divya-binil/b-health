<p>Andrus on Hudson's memory care residents become more engaged and social using a large gaming table designed specifically for people with cognitive challenges. According to research, apathy presents a big challenge for those with dementia. They stop being self-starters, which has a significant negative impact on their emotional and physical health. This makes treating the condition considerably more difficult. The Hastings-on-Hudson, New York-based Andrus on Hudson provides services and care to people with various forms of dementia. These people are referred to as "residents" to represent the setting in which they get care. Negative behaviours that happen during downtimes during the day or the sundown window are one of the main difficulties carers and residents encounter. Agitation and roaming are examples of these undesirable tendencies. While AOH provides care to these people using best practises, such as responding to those unfavourable behaviours. AR and VR can help support individuals with cognitive impairment by:</p><ol><li>Providing immersive experiences to aid in memory recall and reinforcement</li><li>Improving communication skills through interactive and engaging activities</li><li>Providing simulations for skill-building and training</li><li>Offering a safe and controlled environment for therapy and rehabilitation</li><li>Reducing anxiety and improving mood through exposure therapy and virtual relaxation techniques.</li></ol>
