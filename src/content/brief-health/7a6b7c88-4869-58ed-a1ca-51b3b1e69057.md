<p>The insights gleaned from patient conversations within the contact center can unlock a better patient experience.<br><br>Trends like consumerization and reimbursements tied to patient experience have pushed many healthcare providers toward an accelerated digital transformation – including the modernization of the contact center.
They offer the opportunity to better anticipate patient needs, detect correlations between patient interactions and outcomes (such as whether they show up for an appointment), and ultimately help healthcare organizations achieve their end goal – delivering the best care and experience possible and retaining patients.
When those things come together, the insights gleaned from patient conversations within the contact center can unlock a better patient experience.
Interactions within the contact center, coupled with other sources of feedback, provide a much larger data set and a broader representation of experiences of the patient population.
This insight allows healthcare organizations to be more proactive in reducing effort, improving the patient journey, and delivering better experiences, which in turn can lead to better survey results.</p>
