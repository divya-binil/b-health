<p>COVID-19 created a colossal opportunity for health plans and providers to reimagine how they engage with patients. With patients apprehensive about going to the doctor during the pandemic, it became even more vital to keep track of their health in between visits. This is where remote patient monitoring (RPM) becomes critical to every payer and provider’s virtual health strategy. RPM uses digital technologies to collect data about symptoms, medications, treatment, and biometrics from individuals who are not actually in the healthcare facility — usually using an app on the patient’s phone. The app then securely transmits that information to healthcare professionals for assessments and recommendations.</p><p>This process greatly benefits the patient experience because they can track their health easily from their phone, and then receive personalized care advice and recommendations tailored to their specific needs. On the health plan and provider side, RPM enables earlier interventions, improves patient engagement, and collects data that offers a full view into each individual patient’s health.&nbsp;</p>
