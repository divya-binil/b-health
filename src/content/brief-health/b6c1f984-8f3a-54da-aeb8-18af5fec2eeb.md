<p>Telehealth Access for America is aimed at educating members of the public about the need to enact permanent legislation around virtual care services.
"Without action from Congress, millions of Americans who have come to rely on telehealth services will lose access to the care they value," said AHA President and CEO Rick Pollack in a statement.
"Protecting and expanding access to telehealth is essential to strengthening America’s healthcare future.
Congress must act to expand patient choice in every American community, meet patients where they are, and bring health care into the 21st century.
We owe it to our patients to make health care access easier, and patients with Medicare should not be excluded from this opportunity," said Dr. Brian Hasselfeld, medical director of digital health and telemedicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine, in a statement.
"The COVID-19 pandemic showed the potential of telehealth – and it has given policymakers the evidence to validate our long-held beliefs around the capability of telehealth to help ensure all Americans have access to care when and where they most need it," said Alliance for Connected Care Executive Director Krista Drobac in a statement.
In February, several organizations (some of whom are now behind the public education campaign) formed the Telehealth Equity Coalition, aimed at ensuring virtual care benefits everyone.
"Our members strongly support Congressional action on telehealth to ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable healthcare when and where they need it," Bordenick continued.</p>
