<p>The Villages Health's (TVH) case study was published in the Journal of Medical Practice Management, according to KAID Health, a business that develops technology for provider engagement and healthcare analytics. The report showcases two technologies from KAID Health that enhance care delivery: Whole Chart AnalysisTM and NLITETM (Natural Language Insight &amp; Term Extraction). In the The Villages® Community in central Florida, TVH is a healthcare organisation that uses a value-based care approach especially created for seniors who lead active lifestyles. The whole medical record, comprising structured claims, electronic medical record (EMR) data, and insights gleaned from medical notes, may be analysed by physicians using KAID Health's Whole Chart Analysis. By utilising NLITE technology, TVH discovered previously difficult-to-access clinical characteristics on at least 15% of its patient population and gave care teams more thorough information.</p>
