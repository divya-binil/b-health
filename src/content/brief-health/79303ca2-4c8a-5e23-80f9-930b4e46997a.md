The counterintuitive finding that less time s …<br><br>Objective: To evaluate the association of physician productivity and EHR use patterns, as determined by vendor-derived EHR use data platforms, with physician turnover.
Main outcomes and measures: Physician departure from the practice network; 4 time-based core measures of EHR use, normalized to 8 hours of scheduled clinical time; teamwork, percentage of a physician's orders that are placed by other members of the care team; and productivity measures of patient volume, intensity, and demand.
Conclusions and relevance: In this study, physician productivity and EHR use metrics were associated with physician departure.
