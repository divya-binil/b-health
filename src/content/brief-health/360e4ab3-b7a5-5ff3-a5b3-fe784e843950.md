<p>Drive around any medium or large U.S. city, and you’re likely to see a local health system advertising its emergency department (ED) wait times like convenience stores advertise gas prices. But the confidence to advertise one’s wait times often doesn’t track with the reality that patients face when presenting in the ED.</p><p>According to the latest data from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services from the 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, 29 had ED wait times of <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/emergency">20 minutes or longer</a> before being seen by a doctor. Total time spent in the ED exceeded two hours for 40 of the 52 areas. Long wait times aggravate patients and may cause some to leave without being seen or without receiving treatment, resulting in having an adverse impact on patient outcomes.</p>
