<p>Evernorth, the health services arm of insurer Cigna, announced it has added five new programs to its digital health formulary, including offerings from Big Health and Quit Genius.
The new additions to the formulary are Big Health's Sleepio digital therapeutic for insomnia and its Daylight tool for anxiety, Quit Genius' alcohol use disorder and opioid use disorder programs, and HealthBeacon's injectable medication adherence tool for inflammatory conditions.
Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager that is now under the Evernorth portfolio, first announced plans to launch a digital health formulary several years ago. A recent survey of 1,300 physicians by the American Medical Association found more doctors saw digital health tools as an advantage for patient care this year compared with 2016.</p>
