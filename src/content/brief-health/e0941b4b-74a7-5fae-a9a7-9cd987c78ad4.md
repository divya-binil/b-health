<p>The partnership marks another move in home care for the retail giant, which has made several acquisitions in the space over the past few years. The latest development in remote patient monitoring for the tech retailer is a partnership between Best Buy Health and Charlotte, North Carolina-based Atrium Health to create new hospital-at-home services. The companies claimed that their agreement will combine Best Buy's in-home services and supply chain with the health system's well-established telemedicine and hospital-at-home operations. The Geek Squad at Best Buy will help with device setup and technical support. Data from remote patient monitoring devices will be exchanged with providers through Current Health, a Best Buy subsidiaryhub, ,'s according to CNBC. Each day, Best Buy wants to enrol 100 patients in the programme. According to Deborah Di Sanzo, president of Best Buy Health, "We thought Atrium Health was the appropriate partner to assist handle the specific difficulties within the care at home experience."</p>
