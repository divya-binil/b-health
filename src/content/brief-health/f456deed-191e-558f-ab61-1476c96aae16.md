<p>Sonde Health, a voice analysis platform based in the US, will receive a $2 million strategic investment from South Korean telecom giant KT Corporation. According to a press statement, the businesses will work together to upgrade KT's AI-powered voice business solutions using Sonde's voice analysis technology. In addition, KT intends to incorporate Sonde's technology into its Vietnam-based telemedicine platform. It teamed up with local health tech company HurayPositive at the beginning of the year to establish a telemedicine service that is currently geared on diabetes patients and has plans to eventually assist other chronic ailments including high blood pressure. KT is vying for a slice of the voice biomarkers market, which is anticipated to reach over 6 trillion won ($4.5 billion) by 2027.</p>
