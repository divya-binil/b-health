<p>Cybercriminals are a growing threat, and if you weren’t paying attention before, maybe the recent Colonial Pipeline Attack that created a gas shortage in five states and Washington, D.C., caught your attention.</p><p>The perpetrators of this attack may have apologized, but that doesn’t mean every cyberattack will be the same experience. Physicians need to take note of the lessons of this attack as data breaches are <a href="https://www.physicianspractice.com/view/top-two-cybersecurity-threats-facing-physician-practices">trending upward</a> and <a href="https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/growing-cyber-threat-physician-practices">every practice</a> is a target. Patient safety needs to be more than a bedside concern. Here are five questions all practices should ask themselves about whether they have their cybersecurity under control. Practices that are noncompliant may face significant fees, penalties and loss of reputation.</p>
