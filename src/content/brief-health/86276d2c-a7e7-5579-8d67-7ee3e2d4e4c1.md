<p>Complex care pathways are fuelling a patient information explosion and creating workload challenges, particularly in high data-generating departments such as radiology.<br><br>A cloud-enabled AI-based solution that integrates applications in the radiology workflow is one way to streamline data management and realise the concept of ‘radiologists without walls’ - improving efficiency and quality of care.</p><p>The shift towards precision health diagnostics is a major driver of the growing demand for data and services. In the radiology department, this pressure is heightened by staff shortages: many radiologists are nearing retirement age but are not being replaced by a new generation.</p><p>While these trends make the management of patient care pathways more complex, the challenge is exacerbated by an increase in the number of regional projects and mergers, creating yet more data streams.</p><p>A modern clinical viewing platform with enhanced smart workflows and a streamlined architecture would provide imaging departments – and the overall enterprise – with fully integrated data services, while helping to ease the workload for both radiologist and clinician.</p><p><strong>Smart collaboration</strong></p><p>Radiologists can sharpen their focus on patient care by collaborating with an experienced enterprise imaging partner, who can help them to achieve the benefits of a cloud-enabled flexible hosting approach: increased productivity and efficiency, and guaranteed resource allocation across the department or enterprise. Cross-system access to patient data ensures that the right data will always be available to clinicians at the right time.</p><p>A cloud-enabled solution will also help the hospital or department to make more efficient use of its IT resources. While intelligent workflows help the radiology department to reduce reporting times, productivity is also boosted when AI is integrated with the system, improving diagnostic accuracy and boosting productivity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
