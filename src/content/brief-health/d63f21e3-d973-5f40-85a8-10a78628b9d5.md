<p>Picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) and related tools for both radiology and cardiology are some of the products that Change Healthcare continues to pioneer in the healthcare industry's shift from on-premise imaging systems to cloud-native, zero-footprint medical imaging solutions. Cloud-native Stratus Imaging PACS, built with the most recent technology and designed from the ground up for the cloud, offer radiologists in independent practises a simple way to read pictures from many hospitals on one platform, whenever they want, from anywhere. More than 10% of the imaging data from Change Healthcare's current hospital clients has already been transferred to the cloud, totaling more than 6 petabytes. Stratus Imaging Archive is currently live in 45 hospitals, while Stratus Imaging Analytics is live in 73 organisations.</p>
