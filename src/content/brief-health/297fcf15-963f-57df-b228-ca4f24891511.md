<p>In order to determine the viability, resources, and infrastructure required to incorporate actual data from healthcare systems into its systematic review conclusions, the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has established a challenge competition. The Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program at AHRQ creates systematic evaluations that summarise data from peer-reviewed literature and present the state of the art in terms of healthcare delivery methods and technological options. According to AHRQ, the process of developing these reviews is stakeholder-driven, methodologically robust, and open. Clinical practise guidelines recommendations and Medicare's determinations of national coverage are only two examples of how reviews are used to inform healthcare decisions.</p>
