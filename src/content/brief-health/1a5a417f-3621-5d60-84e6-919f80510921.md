<p>The health system's goals include providing high-quality care, access for everyone in the community, a great patient experience and affordable care.
"The goal was to integrate data from many traditional sources and present it via a web portal, enabling patients to view their health records and lab results, and refill medications online.
"Moreover, ThedaCare wanted to integrate the portal's access to the avalanche of digital data streaming from wearables, remote monitors, and the more than 500,000 health-related apps available for patients to use on their phones," he continued.
With all of these goals in mind, in early 2020, ThedaCare turned to digital health, rolling out to its team members, patients and the community at large a digital "front end" to healthcare, with the help of vendor b.well Connected Health.
Dubbed "Ripple by ThedaCare" to illustrate the cumulative power of change on a community, the app and digital platform integrates and analyzes data from virtually any source and presents it in a way that encourages and incentivizes consumers to improve their health while lowering costs.
"Ripple does that by engaging people on the front end, providing patients and our communities a simple, secure way to manage health, save time and, in the process, create greater peace of mind.</p>
