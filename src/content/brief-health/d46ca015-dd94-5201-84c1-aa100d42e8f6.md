<p>The transformation of technology is changing how healthcare services are delivered, and remote patient monitoring (RPM) is leading this change. If we look at the primary facilities that implemented this tool, cardiac specialties will be shown. Due to a long list of benefits, the demand for virtual care is increasing daily. As the pioneer in adopting this technology, cardiac practices are well-positioned to gain long-term and short-term benefits. Despite early adoption, some courses are lagging as they are unfamiliar with the concept.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Applications of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.carecloud.com/remote-patient-monitoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)</a> is designed to engage patients to participate more in their health journey and provide healthcare professionals with all the important patient data even when the patient is not in a traditional facility. This solution benefits many patient applications, such as hypertension management, obesity, and other related problems.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Why Cardiology practices need Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)?</h2>
<p>A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that <em><u>nearly 116 million people in the United States have hypertension</u></em>. Implementing RPM for adults with cardiovascular disease has a positive impact. The <a href="https://www.cardiosmart.org/news/2019/2/latest-statistics-say-nearly-half-of-americans-have-some-form-of-heart-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American College of Cardiology</a> research states that <strong><em><u>“at least 48% of U.S adults have some form of cardiovascular disease.”</u></em></strong> Using the RPM, the doctors can detect any issues before time and can create an effective plan of care beforehand. In this way, the quality of life of patients suffering from these diseases will greatly increase.</p>
<p>The number of patients is increasing rapidly, making it difficult for providers to provide quality care continually. In these situations, RPM is an excellent solution as it also improves the outcomes and enhances patient satisfaction.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">How Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) can Benefit from RPM?</h2>
<p>Now that we have explained the significant importance of RPM in the field of CVD, let&#8217;s look at how this solution can further help healthcare practices benefit from this solution. The highlight of RPM is that it is designed to streamline medical facilities&#8217; workflow and management. Tracking becomes more accessible and mitigates the in-house visits for some patients. In this way, professionals can provide quality care to many patients without burnout.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.carecloud.com/continuum/remote-patient-monitoring-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) devices</a> help identify and address any health crisis. Moreover, it also assists providers in making the right treatment plans by giving them insights into patients&#8217; lifestyles. This software is developed not only to provide top-notch care but also to strengthen patient-doctor relationships.</p>
<h2>Why select Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)?</h2>
<p>It is common to understand that providing RPM service to people above 65 is not an easy task because they need to be technologically upgraded and aware. The reality is quite the opposite because nowadays, people are familiar with technology and use it to stay connected with family and friends. The RPM technology is easy to use, and whoever is capable of using a cellphone can efficiently operate it.</p>
<p>Once the patients acclimatize to the technology, it has a lot of benefits. Patients will participate more in their health journey as it will improve patient engagement. This solution aims to reduce barriers to care, such as location, transportation, and any other similar issues. People living in remote areas and the ones with tough work schedules can have better access to care as the RPM help providers in making timely decisions.</p>
<h2>RPM Coverage</h2>
<p>RPM adoption has increased, due to which most of the insurance payers have expanded coverage for CVD-related conditions. It improves patients&#8217; health and decreases hospital admission rates, resulting in cost savings. Since RPM solutions are gaining popularity, new and improved versions of this software are now available on the market.</p>
<h2>Key Benefits</h2>
<p>The following are some of the main advantages that practices will get by integrating RPM solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>With the help of RPM, healthcare professionals can save time, manage stress, and give patients quality care services</li>
<li>RPM helps patients to get medical services by removing barriers</li>
<li>RPM is an excellent solution for providing care to those patients who are <a href="https://www.carecloud.com/continuum/chronic-care-management-eligibility-criteria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eligible for chronic care management</a>.</li>
<li>RPM is a financially worthwhile solution because it is covered by both federal and private payers</li>
</ul>
<p>Patients are now supporting virtual care, and this is high time for practices to integrate the right RPM solution. Adoption of this solution has surged, and now the ball is in the court of practice to meet this demand.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this article, we have briefly discussed how Remote Patient Monitoring can reduce the prevalence of CVD. We have covered all the significant points, such as applications of RPM, why practices need this solution, and how they can benefit from it. RPM is made to provide patients with chronic conditions an excellent platform to enjoy quality care.</p>
