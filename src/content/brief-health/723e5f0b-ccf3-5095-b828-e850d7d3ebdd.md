<p><i>Nym’s Coding Engine Automates Revenue Cycle Management for Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center, Bringing Greater Accuracy, Efficiency and Speed to Medical Billing and Payment Cycles</i></p><p><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i><strong>Hartford &amp; New York</strong> —March 17, 2022 —<a href="http://www.connecticutchildrens.org/">Connecticut Children’s</a> recently partnered with <a href="https://nym.health/">Nym Health</a>, a leader in transforming clinical language into actionable information, to power innovative, technology-driven revenue cycle management (RCM) for the hospital’s Emergency Medicine division. Ranked by U.S. News &amp; World Report as one of the best children’s hospitals in the nation and designated a Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center, Connecticut’s Children is adopting the Nym engine to automate coding, enable precise and rapid medical billing, and improve payment cycles.</p><p>“At Connecticut Children’s, we’re committed to innovation that will drive the future of pediatric medicine and better care journeys for families across the state. A critical part of this effort involves utilizing technology to ease administrative burdens so our clinicians and staff can focus on the care we deliver,” said Bridgett Feagin, Connecticut Children’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “Nym makes it possible to instantly understand and translate clinical language into accurate and compliant medical billing codes. These capabilities are transformative, so we’re very excited to be the first children’s hospital in the state to be partnering with Nym for this.”</p>
