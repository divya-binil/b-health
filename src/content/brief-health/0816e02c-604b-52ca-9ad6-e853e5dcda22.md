<p>Efficiently handling incoming calls is a challenge for hospitals and health systems. Long hold times and multiple transfers create patient dissatisfaction, while high call volumes and outdated technology increase stress and frustration for operators and agents by making their tasks harder.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Becker's Hospital Review</i> recently spoke with Joseph Maxwell, CEO of Parlance, about how voice recognition is improving the caller experience for leading health systems. He explained that technology-only solutions don't substantially improve patient experience or operator efficiency. Parlance differs from traditional interactive voice response systems by delivering voice recognition technology as a managed service. Leading healthcare organizations use Parlance to continuously optimize call routing, reduce operator workload, and improve the patient caller experience.&nbsp;</p>
