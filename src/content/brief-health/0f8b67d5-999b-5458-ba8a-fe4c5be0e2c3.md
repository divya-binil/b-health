<p>South Korea-based Hyundai Mobis, the car parts arm of the Hyundai Motor Group, has unveiled an integrated vehicle controller with health monitoring capabilities.
Dubbed the Smart Cabin, the controller features four sensors: a 3D camera that captures a driver's posture, an ECG sensor mounted on the steering wheel, an ear-set sensor to measure the brainwaves flowing around the ears, and an HVAC sensor to measure the temperature or humidity and carbon dioxide level of the cabin.
The launch of its Smart Cabin follows the release of M.Brain, the first brainwave-based health monitoring system for drivers developed by Hyundai Mobis.</p>
