<p>Research to involve partnerships between clinical research teams, community organizations on how to address both clinical and social factors driving maternal health disparities. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) will provide funding of up to $63 million for studies on reducing maternal health inequities and up to $50 million for research on using telehealth to improve management of multiple chronic conditions.
The forthcoming Targeted PCORI Funding Announcement (PFA) offering up to $63 million for research conducted by partnerships between clinical research teams and community organizations on how best to address disparities in maternal health outcomes will support research that aims to address both clinical and social factors driving disparities.
PCORI anticipates funding three awards under this forthcoming Targeted PFA to be issued in January 2023, with each awardee having the opportunity to conduct more than one clinical effectiveness research (CER) study with their funds.</p>
