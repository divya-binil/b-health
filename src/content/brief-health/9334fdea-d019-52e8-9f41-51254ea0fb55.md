<p>The latest reductions mark the third round of job cuts at the company in less than a year. The digital weight loss business Noom acknowledged that it had completed a third round of personnel reductions in less than a year. The number of employees impacted by the most recent job layoffs was not disclosed by the corporation. Insider revealed in April that around a quarter of Noom's coaches would be let go. In the fall, it made more reductions; according to TechCrunch, roughly 500 employees or 10% of its workforce were let go. A Noom representative told MobiHealthNews that the company had gone through "amazing growth" over the previous several years and that it was aiming to keep up its momentum in the long run. Due to the challenging economic headwinds affecting firms in all industries.</p>
