<p><i>The following is a guest article by Rahul Varshneya is the co-founder and president of&nbsp;</i><a href="https://arkenea.com/"><i>Arkenea</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>The Coronavirus pandemic forced healthcare communities across the United States into survival mode during the first half of 2020. Several healthcare facilities, both big and small, had to adjust their operations, hastily putting together telemedicine offerings that would allow them to navigate uncharted territory and stay agile.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the second half of that year saw growth potential: attracting new patients, building loyalty as the country emerged on the other side of this health emergency. Consequently, telemedicine sky rocketed. A recent consumer survey conducted by Deloitte shows <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/virtual-health-care-consumer-experience-survey.html">57% of consumers now display willingness to try telehealth</a>, and 77% of consumers have already experienced telehealth services, reporting significant levels of satisfaction.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing is resoundingly certain: telemedicine is not a temporary solution, it will dictate the future of healthcare to a great extent.</p>
