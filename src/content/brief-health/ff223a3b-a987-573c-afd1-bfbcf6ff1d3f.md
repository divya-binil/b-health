<p>Digital oncology solutions can help standardize and improve patient care. Learn how Roche helped set up a Germany-wide molecular tumor board.<br><br>The Marien Hospital in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany treats a number of complex oncology patients. The hospital is based at a single site, with 16 different medical departments, approximately 432 beds, and 1,000 employees. Every year the hospital treats approximately 20,000 inpatients and 50,000 outpatients.1 In collaboration with Roche, Marien Hospital explored the use of digital oncology solutions to improve patient care.</p><h2>Overview&nbsp;</h2><p>As we are moving towards a digital world, with medical knowledge increasing at an exponential rate,2 there is a pressing need for the simplification and standardization of hospital processes to enable healthcare professionals to clearly understand and interpret available data.&nbsp;</p><p>One challenging, yet crucial, process for oncology patient care is the management of tumor board meetings, which involves the handling of large amounts of cancer patient case data and requires the input of multiple specialists to align on the optimal treatment recommendations.</p><p>Adding to the complexity is the advancement in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and an increasing number of available cancer treatment options, which is further progressing the field of oncology towards precision medicine. This leads to a rising need and formation of molecular tumor boards.3, 4</p><p>In 2020, healthcare professionals at the Marien Hospital partnered with<a href="https://diagnostics.roche.com/global/en/services/roche-healthcare-consulting.html"> Roche Healthcare Consultants</a> to establish a standardized and digitalized molecular tumor board workflow for their institution. Prior to this project, the hospital had no molecular tumor boards in place, and a lack of expertise in executing this innovative and complex type of tumor board.&nbsp;</p>
