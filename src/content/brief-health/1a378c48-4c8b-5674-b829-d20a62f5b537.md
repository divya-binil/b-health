<p>$100 billion-plus has poured into telehealth and other digital health ventures, with uneven results. Learn how to optimize digitally enabled care. Despite the introduction of promising new digital health tools to the healthcare industry, there has been little advancement in solving issues related to health care access, quality, results, affordability, and equity. In other words, the American healthcare system has only begun to realise the full potential of digitally enabled care. To bridge the gap between the revolutionary potential of digital health and the reality of its impact thus far, the AMA and Manatt Health have released a report. The paper, "Future of Health: Closing the Digital Health Disconnect: A Blueprint for Optimizing Digitally Enabled Care" (PDF), is based on the opinions of more than 40 executives from medical groups, health systems, digital health businesses, venture capital firms, employers, and health plans. There are pillars in the AMA Future of Health Report.</p><ul><li>Education and Awareness: Education and awareness campaigns can help close the gap in digital health adoption by educating the public about the benefits of digital health tools, such as telemedicine, mobile apps, and wearables. These campaigns can be targeted towards patients, providers, and healthcare organizations.</li><li>Access and Affordability: Improving access to digital health tools, particularly in underserved and rural communities, can help close the gap in adoption. Healthcare organizations and government agencies can work together to make these tools more affordable and accessible to all patients.</li><li>Interoperability: Interoperability refers to the ability of different digital health tools to communicate with each other. Improving interoperability can help patients and providers seamlessly access and share health information, which can improve the overall digital health experience and encourage wider adoption.</li><li>User-Centered Design: Digital health tools that are designed with the user in mind are more likely to be adopted. Healthcare organizations and technology companies can involve patients and providers in the design and development process to create tools that are easy to use, intuitive, and effective.</li><li>Data Privacy and Security: Concerns around data privacy and security can hinder digital health adoption. Healthcare organizations and technology companies must prioritize data security and privacy to build trust with patients and providers and encourage wider adoption of digital health tools.</li><li>Regulatory Framework: An appropriate regulatory framework can help ensure that digital health tools are safe, effective, and meet high standards of quality. Governments can work with healthcare organizations and technology companies to develop a regulatory framework that encourages innovation while protecting patients.</li></ul>
