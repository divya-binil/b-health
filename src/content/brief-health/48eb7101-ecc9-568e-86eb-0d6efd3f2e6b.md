<p>A premier health system chooses Cerner's lab information systems to assist Labcorp in streamlining operations and improving patient experiences. Oracle For one of the top nonprofit Catholic health systems in the country, Cerner and Labcorp, a top global life sciences organisation, have forged a new partnership. The health system's outreach laboratory business had some of its assets purchased by Labcorp, which will now run its hospital-based labs throughout ten states. To improve patient care and lab efficiency, Labcorp will be able to centralise operations and streamline procedures within the hospital-based labs with the use of Cerner's laboratory information system (LIS). With the use of this tactical Cerner partnership, Labcorp will be able to improve upon the technology already in place in the labs, standardise workflows, and optimise workflows for greater lab efficiency.</p>
