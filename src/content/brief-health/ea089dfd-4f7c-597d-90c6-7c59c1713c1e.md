<p>Oncology practices are trying to figure out their next steps for value-based care as a popular payment model concludes in June with no successor in place, with providers worried that access to services will decline.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oncologists told a survey conducted by the advocacy group Community Oncology Alliance they are worried that access to care could be reduced without a successor and that staff responsible for navigating value-based care may be laid off.</p><p>“Overall, practices indicated that the [Oncology Care Model] transformed the patient experience for the better by comprehensively addressing patient needs and disparities,” said COA in a release on Monday.</p><p>The Oncology Care Model started in 2016 and offers oncology practices a way to improve care through an episode-based payment model that pays practices for the total cost of care. Practices could get a monthly enhanced payment for delivering enhanced services like a comprehensive care plan or other patient navigation services.</p><p>Commercial payers also agree to participate in the model to create incentives for physicians to transform their care.</p><p>As of July 2, there were 126 practices and 5 commercial payers — Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina, Cigna, Priority Health and the University of Arizona Health Plan — that were participating in the model.</p>
