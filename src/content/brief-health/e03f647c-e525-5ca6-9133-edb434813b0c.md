This creates a better experience for the patient while increasing provider retention and opportunities for recruitment and enhancing provider recruitment initiatives.&nbsp;</span></li> </ul> <p><span>“We are truly excited about Kirby Medical Center’s forward-thinking approach to proactively give physicians more time to focus on patient care,” says Manny Krakaris, chief executive officer at Augmedix. “We take pride in significantly reducing documentation burden while simultaneously enhancing providers’ job satisfaction and productivity, removing barriers that create physician burnout.”</span></p> <p><span>“Augmedix is a great advantage and I enjoy using the service,” says Dr. Lauren Fore, family medicine physician at Kirby Medical Center. “It has cut down significantly on the amount of time I spent preparing my charts and documenting while talking with patients.”</span></p> <p><b>About Augmedix</b></p> <p><span>Augmedix, Inc. (Nasdaq: AUGX) provides automated medical documentation and data services to large healthcare systems and physician practices, supporting medical offices, clinics, hospitals, emergency departments, and telemedicine nationwide. The company’s Ambient Automation Platform converts the natural conversation between physicians and patients into timely and comprehensive medical notes and performs a suite of related data services. These services relieve physicians of administrative burdens to enable more time for patient care. Augmedix’s proprietary platform uses automatic speech recognition, natural language processing and clinical datasets to capture the ambient visit conversation and generate a structured medical note. The structured medical note data is then used to deliver additional data services. Quality is assured by trained medical documentation specialists.
