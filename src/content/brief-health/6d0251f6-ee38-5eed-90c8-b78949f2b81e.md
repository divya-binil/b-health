<p>The organizations said Medicare Advantage members in 24 counties will have access to the rural provider's services. In order to improve access for residents in rural Minnesota, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota announced that it had engaged into a full-risk value-based care agreement with hybrid startup Homeward. Medicare Advantage customers in 24 Minnesota counties outside of the Twin Cities metropolitan area will be able to use Homeward's services, according to the insurer and the rural healthcare company. The organisation provides virtual care in addition to in-person and community-based appointments. Homeward and Blue Cross stated that they are attempting to locate people who either have gaps in their treatment or are not currently receiving the assistance they require. Additionally, they want to extend Homeward's services to more counties. Dr. Mark Steffen, senior vice president of Blue Cross, said: "Our partnership with Homeward is another crucial step for Blue Cross' nationally renowned Medicare Advantage programmes."</p>
