<p>The HIMSS 2022 Healthcare Cybersecurity Forum will bring together the industry's top cybersecurity leaders to share tips on how to safeguard healthcare's growing digital footprint. The extensive programme for this year, which is slated for December 5â€“6 in Boston, consists of a variety of business and technology panels and keynote speeches covering important, current issues. As decision-makers manage security and risk in constantly evolving technological and threat landscapes, they face difficulties related to the workforce and organisational culture. Additionally, experts will discuss ethical issues, equity, and security in edge computing. As professionals offer their ideas on risk management and quantification, attendees will learn how to better their current security procedures. Experts in standards and policy provide updates on how to adjust priorities, processes, and policies to the new normal in cybersecurity standards.&nbsp;</p>
