      In 1975, 27-year-old Mark Baiada invested his life savings of $16,000 in a
      belief that people deserve a safe home life with comfort, independence,
      and dignity. He sought compassionate care professionals who shared his
      passion and treated them like family, and they, in turn, treated their
      clients like family. Today, more than 26,000 like-hearted employees call
      upon their natural sense of caring, commitment to purpose, and personal
      responsibility to help our clients and each other flourish.


      BAYADA has become a trusted leader in providing a full range of clinical
      care and support services at home for children and adults of all ages.
      With more than 350 offices in 22 states and 8 countries, BAYADA has
      remained true to Mark's commitment to purpose by finding, training, and
      supporting employees who take pride and joy in healing and helping.

<h2>Pennsylvania Direct Care Workers Recognized for Outstanding Service, Exceptional Care</h2><h3><i>PHA’s 2022 Direct Care Worker of the Year Awards Recognize Statewide, Regional Winners</i></h3><p>Today, the Pennsylvania Homecare Association and the Pennsylvania Department of Aging announced the recipients of the 2022 Direct Care Worker of the Year Awards. For more than fifteen years, PHA has recognized direct care workers who display outstanding service and exceptional care in their communities.</p><p>In 2020, PHA expanded the awards program to recognize three regional winners, in addition to the overall statewide “Vicki Hoak Direct Care Worker of the Year.” This year, 168 direct care workers from across Pennsylvania were nominated for awards.</p><p>Dina Berzin, BAYADA Home Health Care – Willow Grove, was the overall statewide winner, recognized for the love, compassion, and understanding that she brings to her work and her consumers.</p><p>Kelli Carper, Superior Home Care, Allegheny County, Kereen Wright, Main Line Health Home Care and Hospice, Delaware County, and Patty McVicker, First Choice in Home Care, Bedford County, were this year’s regional winners. Each was recognized for their compassion, reliability,&nbsp; and commitment to caring for others.</p><p>While the annual awards program has a long history of highlighting the valuable role of direct care workers in our community, this year’s program is especially important as the home care industry continues to face a crisis-level shortage of direct care workers.</p><p>“The need to recognize and reward direct care workers has never been greater,” said Teri Henning, CEO of the Pennsylvania Homecare Association. “At a time when the state has significant COVID-related and other funds, this year’s budget must increase Medicaid reimbursement rates to recognize the value of these dedicated healthcare workers. PHA and the Department of Aging’s annual program is one small way to show how much we respect and value their role in the delivery of care. We urge Pennsylvania lawmakers and the administration to join us this budget season to recognize the worth of this workforce to allow for higher wages.”</p><p><i>About PHA… </i>The Pennsylvania Homecare Association is a statewide membership organization of more than 700 homecare, home health and hospice providers. PHA members provide quality care and serve as advocates for their patients and clients on a variety of healthcare related issues. PHA and its members work to improve professional standards and ensure access to quality homecare throughout the Commonwealth.
