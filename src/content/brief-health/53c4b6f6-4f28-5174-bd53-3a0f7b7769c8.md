<p>The Top 25 Healthcare Technology CTOs of 2022 have been announced by The Healthcare Technology Report. The success of businesses engaged in the healthcare technology sector depends on their chief technology officers. They not only manage teams made up of engineers, software developers, chemists, scientists, and others, but they also give their management teams the freedom to pursue some of the most cutting-edge technological visions, pave the way for R&amp;D, and ultimately guide innovations from conception to commercialization. The businesses on this list offer a range of services, including software, medical equipment, and virtual care, but what unites them is the cutting-edge technology at their core. Achin Bhowmik, CTO and EVP of Engineering, is among the outstanding leaders on this year's list.</p>
