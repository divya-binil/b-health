<p>The company's mobile solution creates a secure casting connection from a mobile device with Samsung Smart Healthcare TVs to integrate electronic health records (EHRs) as well as other sources of content, the companies said.
According to Samsung, its the first 4K QLED smart healthcare TV in the industry and transforms in-room displays into all-in-one communication hubs personalized for hospital patients and senior care residents, significantly improving collaboration, patient engagement and workflow efficiency.
"Our mobile-to-Samsung Smart Healthcare TV integration not only optimizes the real estate on the large screen but creates an entire new canvas for improving patient care," said Robert Hanson, CEO of ShareSafe, in a statement.</p>
