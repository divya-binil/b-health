<p>Hospitals produce large volumes of data each year and modern technologies, such as AI, machine learning, and automation, help medical researchers make sense of these huge amounts of data to improve patient outcomes.
Dr Ngiam Kee Yuan, chief technology officer at NUHS, mentioned that it usually takes days to train AI models with big data "but the new supercomputer could help to cut our training times down to hours allowing our medical and para-medical staff to optimise patient trajectories and to improve the quality of patient care".</p>
