<p>In a new essay titled "From Cuff To Cuff less: The Evolution Of Blood Pressure Monitoring," Dr. Bertalan Mesko, PhD, examines how phot plethysmography (PPG) and the development of cuff less technology have helped to advance blood pressure monitoring. The essay, which was published on June 29, 2023, examines the development of blood pressure monitoring and emphasizes the switch from conventional cuff-based techniques to more advanced and practical cuff less options. Coffles monitoring with PPG offers a non-invasive and user-friendly method of recording blood pressure and is driven by improvements in artificial intelligence and health sensor technology. The essay emphasizes the possible impact on personalized healthcare and remote patient monitoring while discussing the advantages and difficulties of this developing technology.&nbsp;</p>
