<p>Back in 2016, CHIME <a href="https://www.healthcareittoday.com/2016/01/19/leading-healthcare-it-association-announces-1-million-initiative-to-protect-patients-from-life-threatening-medical-errors/">announced</a> a <a href="https://www.healthcareittoday.com/tag/chime-national-patient-id-challenge/">$1 million Patient ID challenge</a>.&nbsp; CHIME teamed up with HeroX (which co-founded the XPRIZE) to run a year-long competition to develop a National Patient ID solution.&nbsp; They planned to announce the $1 million winner in Feb 2017 at the CHIME-HIMSS CIO Forum.&nbsp; Here’s the challenge description from the HeroX <a href="https://www.herox.com/PatientIDChallenge">website</a>:</p><p><i>Ensure 100% accuracy of every patient’s health info to reduce preventable medical errors and eliminate unnecessary hospital costs/resources.</i></p><p>For those of us that work in health IT, the challenge of patient identification and matching is a well known and complicated problem.&nbsp; Plus, government regulations that don’t allow for a national patient ID or even any sort of research or discussion of a national patient identifier make it even more challenging.&nbsp; Improving patient identification and matching is something we all want fixed.</p><p>After CHIME’s announcement of the Patient ID Challenge, they started with a Concept Blitz round that included <a href="https://www.herox.com/PatientIDChallenge/update/386">113 submissions</a> and over 344 innovators registered for the challenge.&nbsp; On June 1, 2016, 5 independent judges selected 23 proposals as semifinalists, 8 submissions were chosen as finalists, and two winners for the Concept Blitz Round: Michael Braithwaite and Mark Schroeder.</p>
