<p>Femtech developer Aspira Women's Health signs with Dana Farber to license a biomarker-based ovarian cancer diagnostic, a Madrona Venture Labs spin-out adds GPT-enabled virtual agents to billing automation and Dave, an LLM oncology tool, is born. As health IT suppliers work to incorporate artificial intelligence into their products for provider operations, medical testing, patient interaction, and other use cases, innovation is accelerating. Only three businesses Aspira Women's Health, Belong.life, and Outbound AIâ€”have introduced new AI-driven tools that assist advanced ovarian cancer diagnosis, oncology patient interaction, and billing administration, respectively. Outbound AI, a Seattle-based company launched in 2021, declared on Tuesday that it had added generative AI to its cloud-powered PayerVA Console, which "augments human talent" while lightening the workload of billing specialists.
