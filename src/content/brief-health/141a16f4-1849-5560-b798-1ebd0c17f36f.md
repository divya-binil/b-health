<p>The image analysis software is FDA-cleared and CE-marked and aids in the diagnosis and monitoring of individuals with neurological diseases. The FDA-approved brain MRI quantification software from the Belgian-based AI startup icometrix is now reimbursable thanks to a CPT III code from the American Medical Association. In order to help clinicians identify, track, and assess treatment outcomes in patients with neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease and dementia, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, stroke, and Parkinson's disease, icometrix AI-supported quantitative brain analysis software provides metrics for cerebral MRI scans. The icometrix brain imaging AI software can be used by licensed healthcare providers to document practice expenses. To expand its brain software, icometrix secured $18 million in investment in 2019. The Belgian firm received FDA approval.</p>
