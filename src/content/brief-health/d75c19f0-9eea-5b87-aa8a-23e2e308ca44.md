<p>eVisit will add the virtual care management platform's digital front door and integrated language services to its offerings. Bluestream Health, a virtual care management platform for healthcare professionals and health organisations, was bought by Arizona-based virtual care platform eVisit. In addition to scheduling, waiting room management, intake, and discharge, eVisit provides a telemedicine platform. A virtual care platform called Bluestream assists physical facilities in changing workflows to one that includes numerous patient front doors, triage and escalation, and clinical delivery options. With the acquisition, eVisit will be able to expand its portfolio with digital front doors, integrated language services, and other technological advancements. "eVisit and Bluestream share a common ethos of empowering complex healthcare delivery organisations on their journey to transform care with a digital-first approach," says the statement. We think that in order to unite traditionally diverse competencies, such organisations need a specific operating platform.</p>
