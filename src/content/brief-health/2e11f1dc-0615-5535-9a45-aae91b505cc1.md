<p>With this strategy, healthcare providers can enable better access and improved data management and administration.<br><br>Medical imaging plays a significant role in an array of conditions and treatments. A patient's&nbsp;journey through a healthcare system is commonly tracked via a digital patient record, provisioned by an EMR. However, many aspects of imaging and its associated content are poorly integrated with EMR software, leaving significant gaps in the care record. The complexity and variety of imaging, diagnostic procedures and reports integration with digital care records, is challenging.</p><p><strong>What is Enterprise Imaging?</strong></p><p>Some healthcare providers are therefore turning to an enterprise imaging strategy to centralise and consolidate all imaging data and associated content into a centralised platform, thereby allowing better access and improved data management and administration.</p>
