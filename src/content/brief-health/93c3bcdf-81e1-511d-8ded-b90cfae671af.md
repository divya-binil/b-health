<p>In order to, among other things, reduce inpatient length of stay and readmission rates, the New York health system introduced telemedicine in 2019 and significantly diversified its offerings. Based in Vestal, New York, United Health Services Hospitals is a health system that provides care to South Central New York. The UHS Virtual Walk-In was the first component of its virtual healthcare initiative, which debuted in July 2019. A direct patient option for mild, urgent ailments was the Virtual Walk-In. Because Zipnosis can combine an asynchronous adaptive interview process with a step-up to video, it was chosen as the technology platform. Sean J. Britton, system programme manager, UHS virtual healthcare, stated that "the offering is manned completely by the same clinicians who staff our in-person walk-in facilities."</p>
