<p>Simon-Kucher's Jan Bordon and Kay Schultze discuss how to encourage uptake for digital health products. The digital immaturity of many healthcare and life science organisations caught Jan Bordon off guard when consultant Simon-Kucher performed its digital health trends report in 2019. The COVID-19 epidemic forced businesses to seriously explore digital tools and strategy, which led to a change in that situation in 2022. However, the current problem facing the healthcare industry is convincing doctors to utilise and suggest digital health technologies. In order to explore the most recent digital health trends research and what providers desire from digital health, Bordon and Kay Schultze, senior manager at Simon-Kucher, sat down with MobiHealthNews. Feb. Bordon When it comes to prescribing DTx digital therapeutics or prescribing solutions that are intended to be used by the patient, I believe it is important to distinguish between patient-centric solutions and HCP-centric solutions, where the HCP uses software or an AI algorithm to diagnose or to make better decisions. I believe we now see a significant difference between HCPs from a more patient-centered approach, which was also one of the study's emphasis areas. There are still HCPs that are lagging behind, not truly being open, and still having serious doubts regarding the efficacy of digital therapeutics as a therapeutic choice. Then there are the champions, especially so the younger, more certain individuals who are really driving it.</p>
