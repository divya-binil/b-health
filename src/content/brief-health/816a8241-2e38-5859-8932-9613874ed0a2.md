<p>Brian Selfridge at CORL Technologies takes a look at the rise of fourth-party risk in healthcare and how organizations can combat it. A series of high-profile cyberattacks in recent years have completely rocked the healthcare sector. Critical data has been compromised, critical services have been shut down, and healthcare providers are now dealing with disgruntled patients and uncaring regulators.

Think of this blog article as a comprehensive reference to the risks posed by fourth-party providers. In addition to providing definitions, we'll discuss current risk mitigation models, difficulties, and recommendations below.</p>
