<p>Mental healthcare may be among the more intuitive specialties to deliver via telemedicine – but privacy demands, technology difficulties and the need for safe places deter some from taking advantage. The biggest ways telehealth is changing America's treatment of mental health.
What impact increased telehealth accessibility has had on mental health treatment.
The improvements that can be made to telehealth for the treatment of mental health.
As telehealth widens, the availability of mental health services continues to grow and is more accessible than ever.
COVID-19 accelerated the need for more access and new ways of treating mental health, such as telehealth.
Being able to speak with a mental health professional from home has provided patients the ability to choose a setting that provides the most comfort, making the process of opening up and sharing concerns with a new person much easier. People living in rural communities or underserved areas, specifically, experience limited access to specialty healthcare services, especially mental health.
Lastly, telehealth allows those with language barriers in the U.S. to have access to a broader group of mental health professionals who can provide a better understanding of their cultural backgrounds, partnered with the ability to speak in their preferred language.
 While telehealth has expanded access to mental healthcare for so many across the country, there are still limitations that may lead some to favor in-person care.
While some people prefer their care virtual for a variety of reasons, others feel that virtual mental healthcare is cold and distant, and favor in-person care in order to feel more engaged with their mental health provider.</p>
