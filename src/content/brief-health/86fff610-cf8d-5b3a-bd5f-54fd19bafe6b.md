<p>There are many threats if we let medical innovation run wild. We collected 10 hazards that technology brings about in the digital health age. The emergence of digital health has made the future of medicine incredibly intriguing. Better therapies are now more widely available to individuals than ever before thanks to technological developments that democratise access to healthcare. Destructive illnesses have been eliminated thanks to medical advances, while others have been made treatable. However, the very innovations that bring healthcare into the twenty-first century also pose a number of risks. There are warning indications of alarming trends that few people take seriously, ranging from the eradication of privacy through compromised medical gadgets to bioterrorism. Nevertheless, we need to start a conversation about these problems and aid in getting everyone involved ready to deal with them. In order to achieve this, we compiled ten of the most significant risks that technology poses in the era of digital health. To avoid designing unethical digital health innovations, one should consider the following guidelines:</p><ul><li>Respect for privacy and confidentiality: Ensure that personal health information is protected and kept confidential.</li><li>Transparency: Be transparent about how personal health information is collected, stored, and used.</li><li>Fairness: Ensure that all users have equal access to digital health services, and that the technology does not discriminate against certain groups of people.</li><li>Responsibility: Take responsibility for the impact of your technology on people's health and well-being.</li><li>Ethical decision-making: Consider the ethical implications of your technology and engage in ethical decision-making processes.</li><li>User-centered design: Put the needs and perspectives of users at the center of your design process.</li><li>Evidence-based: Base your technology on rigorous scientific evidence and continuously evaluate its impact.</li><li>Collaboration: Work with stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and ethics experts, to ensure that your technology is aligned with ethical principles.</li></ul>
