<p>In this episode, join us as we speak with paediatrician Hilary M. Bowers on the significance of integrating behavioral and mental health care within primary care settings. By the time they are 18, one in five children and adolescents will have received a behavioral or mental health diagnosis. Additionally, since the COVID-19 epidemic began, the prevalence of young depression symptoms has doubled. Hilary talks about how her organization, which treats about 270,000 children from birth to age 21, effectively included mental health treatment into their pediatric medical division. She focuses on how crucial it is to choose a champion and build a network of allies inside community-based organizations.&nbsp;</p>
