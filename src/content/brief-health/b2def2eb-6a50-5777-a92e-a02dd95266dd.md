<p>The ONC study of national survey data examined the percentage by race and ethnicity of patients offered access to a patient portal, and the role of providers in facilitating the process. For those offered access, health disparities largely diminished. In order to detect racial and ethnic discrepancies in patient portal offerings, access, and use, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT looked at the most recent annual health information trends survey conducted by the National Cancer Institute. In an effort to develop more successful health communication strategies for various populations, the NCI's Health Information National Trends Survey has been gathering nationally representative data about the American public's knowledge of, attitudes toward, and use of health-related information since 2003. Although there has been an overall increase in patient portal engagement, there have been persistent disparities in patients' access to and use of online medical records, according to earlier research, wrote study coauthor Chelsea Richwine, an economist with ONC's Office of Technology, in a blog post summarising the findings published on Thursday.</p><p>Racial disparities in patient access to their health data can have several negative consequences. For example:</p><ol><li>Lack of access to health data can make it difficult for patients to fully understand their own health status and make informed decisions about their care.</li><li>Patients who are unable to access their own health data may be less likely to adhere to treatment plans, leading to worse health outcomes.</li><li>Disparities in access to health data can contribute to systemic inequities in healthcare, as certain racial or ethnic groups may receive lower quality care due to their lack of access to necessary information.</li><li>Limited access to health data can also limit the ability of researchers to study and understand health disparities, hindering efforts to address and eliminate these disparities.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
