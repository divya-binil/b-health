<p>Ordr, the leader in connected device security, today announced new capabilities and enhancements to its AI-powered platform to help organizations discover, gain essential context, and secure their connected devices everywhere.
New integrations expand the more than 80 integrations within the Ordr Data Lake, to empower organizations with a single source of truth about connected devices and assets in their on-prem, remote, data center, private, public, and hybrid cloud environments.
In addition, enhancements have been made to Ordr's automated segmentation capabilities that help organizations accelerate and scale adoption of a true Zero Trust security posture to protect every connected device.
Ordr announced enhancements to help organizations discover, gain essential context, and secure their connected devices.
The new integrations are a good leading indicator of challenges organizations face, and Ordr is defining how connected device security needs to continue to evolve."
Ordr Data Lake enrichment - Integrate with more than 80 tools across the IT infrastructure to gather and enrich connected device details, establishing a single source of truth.</p><p>CrowdStrike - See every managed connected device, identify unmanaged devices, and know more about device vulnerabilities and risk, combining Ordr insights with CrowdStrike security data.
Organizations have struggled to achieve a true Zero Trust security posture because they lack insights needed to understand their connected devices and create appropriate security policies.
To truly achieve Zero Trust, organizations need deep visibility into connected devices – to understand how and what they're communicating with – in order to to define, manage, and enforce segmentation.
"Ordr provides the visibility and context into all connected devices to advance our segmentation journey with Cisco ISE," said Shawn Fletcher, Senior Systems Administrator, St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton.
The feature enhancements in Ordr 8.1 will further simplify and optimize how we create and enforce segmentation policies for every connected device," said Larry Smith, Manager, Cybersecurity Architecture and Engineering, El Camino Health.
For more information about how Ordr can help security and IT teams deliver visibility and security for their connected devices, from ground to cloud.
Ordr Systems Control Engine uses deep packet inspection and advanced machine learning to discover every device, profile its risk and behavior, map all communications and protect it with automated policies.</p>
