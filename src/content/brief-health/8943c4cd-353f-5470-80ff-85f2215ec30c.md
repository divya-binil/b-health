<p>This comes after the health tech startup restructured its business in May. Health tech startup MFine has agreed to merge with the diagnostics business of Indian biotechnology company LifeCell and form a new entity called LifeWell.
With LifeCell's full-stack diagnostics and MFine's deep technology capabilities, the joint venture is said to be uniquely positioned in India's growing healthcare delivery market, which outpatient segment alone is worth $20 billion.
"With this joint venture, we see immense possibilities of delivering on-demand healthcare with outstanding consumer experience… Together with [LifeCell], we have an integrated care delivery experience that's unmatched and can scale rapidly across the country," MFine co-founders Prasad Kompalli and Ashutosh Lawania also commented.</p>
