<p>In pursuit of more accurate and equitable AI models, the health system is broadening the distributed network to include deidentified datasets in Brazil, Israel and Canada. The Mayo Clinic announced on Friday that a trio of new health system partners will help it expand its Mayo Clinic Platform_Connect dispersed data network abroad. The data-sharing network intends to increase its capacity in order to support more sophisticated and accurate artificial intelligence applications through new partnerships with the University Health Network of Canada, Israel's Sheba Medical Centre, and Brazil's Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. These three healthcare organisations join Mercy, situated in Missouri, which started working with Mayo Clinic in 2022 on a 10-year data sharing and model validation collaboration. With the latest addition, Mayo Clinic Platform_Connect now provides secure cloud-based access to deidentified data for physicians and researchers on three continents. Each health system will have access to enormous datasets to work with thanks to Mayo's "Data Behind Glass" concept, eliminating the need to transfer data between systems.</p>
