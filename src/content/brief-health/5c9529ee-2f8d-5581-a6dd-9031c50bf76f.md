<p>The LexisNexis® GravitasTM Network, a fully interoperable real-world data hub powered by precise data linking technology and high-quality, de-identified datasets from strategic data partners, was just announced by LexisNexis Risk Solutions, the industry's leading provider of healthcare data analytics and technology. Premier datasets for studies on health equity and precision medicine are among the first cohort of companies to join the network. When combined with core data assets from LexisNexis Risk Solutions, the network enables more inclusive and sophisticated clinical research, ultimately leading to better health outcomes. Clinical researchers need to fully comprehend people's varied patient journeys, distinctive lifestyles, socioeconomic factors, comorbidities, and more in order to develop novel therapies and life-saving treatments quickly, but existing data networks find it difficult to accurately link the disparate datasets necessary to build that comprehensive picture.</p>
