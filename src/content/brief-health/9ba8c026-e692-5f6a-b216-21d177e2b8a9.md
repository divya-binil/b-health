<p>Feel Therapeutics Inc., a pioneer in digital precision medicine for mental health, today announced that US Patent No. 11,410,682, titled "Method for detecting and recognising an emotional state of a user," was recently granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office. Feel Therapeutics' technology for detecting emotions is based on cutting-edge signal processing and machine learning techniques. In order to provide individualised assistance or therapeutic interventions, these algorithms examine vital signs and look for patterns that correspond to particular emotions. Through a wearable device worn by the user, the technology passively and continually gathers physiological signs as well as voice and other digital data from the mobile phone and Feel Therapeutics' application.</p>
