<p>KLAS report examines which PM vendors best deliver to customers’ expectations for midsize and large practices as well as for independent. The majority of practise management (PM) systems have been on the market for a while, but not all suppliers are able to satisfy practises' needs, which include robust technology and a vendor that works with customers to ensure their success. KLAS has traditionally divided PM data into midsize (practises with 11–75 physicians) and large practises (practises with 76+ physicians); however, independent practises (clinics not owned by a hospital/health system) and owned practises (clinics owned by a hospital/health system) also have different needs and lean toward different vendors. Due to this trend, the most recent KLAS analysis looks at which PM suppliers best meet clients' needs for independent and owned practises as well as for midsize and large practises. Examining the Vendors that Stand Out in a Well-Developed Market. KLAS conducts hundreds of healthcare professionals' interviews each year.</p>
