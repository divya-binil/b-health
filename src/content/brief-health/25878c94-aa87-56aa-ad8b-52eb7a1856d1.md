<p>To complicate matters more, the rising number of vaccine mandates across hospital systems has the potential to put the entire industry in a serious bind.
The larger healthcare talent pool resulting from these deep cuts and layoffs, coupled with access to a new national, all-remote workforce created a near-ideal staffing market for hospitals.
Compounding an already challenging labor market, increasing numbers of vaccine mandates for employees at hospitals and health systems has the potential to put further strain on hiring and the number of vacant mission-critical positions left open as a result.
As of early August, nearly 1,500 hospitals have required employees to receive COVID-19 vaccines, and those numbers are rising by the day.</p>
