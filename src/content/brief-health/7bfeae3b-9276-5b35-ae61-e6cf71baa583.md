<p>2022 was a year full of inventions and innovations. Last year there have been considerable strides in almost all spheres of the scientific periphery. From efficient renewable energy to life-like robots, the year tested the limit of possibilities. Perhaps some of the most considerable progress has been made in the field of medical sciences ranging from improved diagnostics to path-breaking cures.&nbsp; Here is our pick of the 11 best medical science innovations of 202. Using PSMA Diagnostics to Detect Prostate Cancer Quickly. Over the past few decades, prostate cancer has become a significant issue for men's health. Prostate cancer affects over 13% of all males, with patients over 65 making up the majority of cases. It is also widespread among non-Hispanic races and can cause major consequences if not caught early. The traditional method of diagnosis involves bone and CT scanning, which frequently misses the early-stage cancer-forming tumour. However, a novel method of diagnosis has been established using PSMA, a protein that is primarily located on the tumor's surface tissue.</p>
