<p>Structural racism and poverty are correlated with a higher incidence of obesity among Black Americans (49%). Social drivers of health, which impact a disproportionate number of non-white Americans who live below the poverty line, account <a href="https://nam.edu/social-determinants-of-health-101-for-health-care-five-plus-five/">for as much as 90%</a> of individuals’ health outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These are just two examples of data that highlight the need for equity.&nbsp;</p><p>Health plans are well-aware that shifting this dynamic and boosting clinical <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hpb20130214.898775/full/">outcomes</a> is possible through better, more personalized member engagement. But by and large, the healthcare system is not adequately set up to engage individuals who need the most help, including the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5876976/">133 million Americans</a> who live with at least one preventable chronic disease. Most healthcare interventions intended to motivate or engage members to improve their health don’t align with members’ day-to-day needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, most health system interventions lack equitability.&nbsp;</p>
