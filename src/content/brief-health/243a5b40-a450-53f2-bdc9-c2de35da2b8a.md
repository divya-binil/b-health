    HCA sold nearly 50 of the home health locations, hospices and therapy
    agencies it picked up earlier this year. The hospital chain is placing all
    its chips on existing networks and has few qualms about selling off
    locations and services outside of its established markets, according to its
    chief financial officer.

The executive said that the organization has an arsenal of programs and initiatives that it can lean on to weather the storm, such as its temporary staffing agency, shift bonuses and CHIP coverage. HCA will need to be responsive with these tools in areas that face staffing drop-offs, but so far Rutherford said he has not heard of a need for any large-scale or system-wide sign-on bonuses to attract talent.

Regarding COVID-19 vaccines, the executive said that the organization has had numerous discussions on whether to require the shots as a condition of employment but has not yet taken a solid position either way. Rutherford characterized the decision as an ongoing consideration and stressed that HCA as a whole is encouraging vaccination and vaccine-supportive policies across its workforce.
