<p>– The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) and its Recognized Coordinating Entity (RCE), The Sequoia Project, published the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA), creating the baseline legal and technical requirements that will enable secure, nationwide information sharing across different health care entities, completing a critical 21st Century Cures Act requirement.
Entities will soon be able to apply to be designated as QHINs. These QHINs will connect to one another and enable their participants (i.e., health care providers, payers, public health agencies) to engage in health information exchange across the country.
This flexible structure allows stakeholders—such as health information networks, ambulatory practices, hospitals, health centers, federal government agencies, public health agencies, and payers—to benefit from TEFCA through improved access to health information.
Individuals will also be able to benefit from TEFCA and seek access to their health information through entities that offer individual access services.
“Operationalizing TEFCA within the Biden Administration’s first year was a top priority for ONC and is critical to realizing the 21st Century Cures Act’s goal of a secure, nationwide health information exchange infrastructure,” said Micky Tripathi, Ph.D., national coordinator for health information technology.</p>
