<p>In order to quickly identify a brain tumor's genetic identification during surgery, scientists have developed an AI tool. This is vital knowledge that, using the existing method, can take a few days or even a few weeks to learn. While the patient is still on the operating table, neurosurgeons can make decisions such as how much brain tissue to remove and whether to administer tumor-killing medications directly to the brain by knowing the molecular type of the tumor. The journal Med published a report on the work, which was directed by researchers from Harvard Medical School, on July 7. A neurosurgeon can determine how much brain tissue to remove during surgery with the aid of accurate molecular diagnosis, which describes DNA abnormalities in a cell.&nbsp;</p>
