<p>“We are proud to work closely with AstraZeneca on a wide array of research and diagnostic avenues in the UAE,” said Ashish Koshy, CEO of G42 Healthcare.
This latest announcement follows the recent signing of a Declaration of Collaboration between AstraZeneca and the Department of Health (DoH) Abu Dhabi in October to enhance innovation in the UAE healthcare sector by “addressing the government’s strategy to increase patients’ access to quality healthcare services and treatments locally and beyond”.
“With the increasing incidence of chronic diseases, cancer, and haematological disorders that require life-saving drugs, the MENA region needs a sustainable and robust clinical research infrastructure,” Dr. Walid Zaher, CEO of IROS and Chief Research Officer at G42 Healthcare, said during IROS’s official launch in September.
“This collaboration allows us to explore greater possibilities in clinical research and diagnostics which will help us create a more patient-centric healthcare sector in the UAE.”</p>
