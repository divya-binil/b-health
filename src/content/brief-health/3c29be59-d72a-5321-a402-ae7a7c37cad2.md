<p>Telehealth usage in the last year has increased by <a href="https://blog.definitivehc.com/covid-19-drives-6000-percent-growth-telemedicine-use">6,000%</a>. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, health care providers and patients rapidly shifted to virtual visits from traditional office care to reduce infection rates. There are other fantastic benefits for patients: appointments when you want them, no travel time, and no paper gowns. The data are clear that we’ve reached a tipping point in both<a href="https://mhealthintelligence.com/news/covid-19-telehealth-delivery-reaps-high-patient-satisfaction"> patient satisfaction</a> and demand for telehealth visits.</p><p>Beyond the shifting of traditional healthcare to virtual platforms, the world of Direct to Consumer (D2C) Telehealth has expanded, particularly in the area of women’s health.</p><p>D2C companies connect people with healthcare providers directly via their app or website without a referral or relationship with an existing health system. Some are offered as part of a covered benefits package from an employer. Women can now quickly connect with a healthcare provider for pregnancy care, birth control prescriptions, mental health, lactation support and more. With women controlling 80% of healthcare spending and being <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_13/sr13_149.pdf">33% more likely to see a doctor than men</a> it’s an obvious opportunity for investment and has seen a significant growth curve.</p><p>I spoke with Megan Zweig, COO of Rock Health, and Jasmine DeSilva, Research Manager at Rock Health about trends they are seeing in the funding of women’s telehealth companies.</p><p>According to the<a href="https://rockhealth.com/about/"> Rock Health team</a>, “Between 2011 and 2015, women+ focused telemedicine startups did not raise any venture funding. In 2015, these startups raised $17M across just four deals. Fast forward to 2018, that number increased to $265M across eight deals. So far in 2021, women+ focused telemedicine startups raised $548M in funding across just five deals with an average deal size of $109.6M (triple that of 2018’s $33.1M average); this was spearheaded by Ro’s $500M mega-deal in March 2021.”</p>
