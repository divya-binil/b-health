      Jvion helps healthcare professionals and systems prevent avoidable harm
      and associated costs by enabling clinical staff and care coordinators to
      focus attention, resources and individualized care strategies on patients
      whose outcomes can be improved. Unlike traditional AI and predictive
      analytic solutions that merely identify high-risk patients and cause alarm
      fatigue, Jvion pinpoints the impactable patients who are on a risk
      trajectory that can be changed and provides the patient-specific
      recommendations that will drive to a better outcome.

**ATLANTA – AUGUST 4, 2021** – [Jvion](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=V5yefmFU_lz2GpFk9tvgfaWHFPFY_QwpceP_hvgZ3KBof2FMrdXvq_JzxwEdOU26), a leader in prescriptive intelligence, today announced that its clinical AI-powered [social determinants of health (SDOH)](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yt2tT9gWIsHfVaHrh_70msMNvloHrOE3dnxK0iUhXhXTSHuE1vyKcY7xFWSz2d-jNEhWzd_Mmu0iOM-1MhvKPs81EHi5GPOvTrzcrIGqpe4i2yRLqhRVSJLrQwlOKC3ND5MhTCFAhxKZX6NoAamj5lQ0UW4BbeDNpxYOfcDaV34=) and [behavioral health](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bM-nv_SwPxCom9z4qg7zEOhh9WVwPk_r0ZnPEt85Iu23lEx0iRMpsaye5H2lKzP47WhKw0bQIKwOoXqsJDaN9s3CihVrDqSNk1cduGpU7BYj2JeUYF6JDfbVPSpNycFd) insights will be integrated with Cerner products at the point of care. The new collaboration is designed to provide Cerner clients with an accurate and concise way to identify and address SDOH and behavioral health factors driving patient risk while offering context and clinical guidance to adopt for improved health outcomes.

“We know the impact that social factors have on our health: from access to healthy food, to social support networks, to exposure to environmental toxins, to the ability to take time off work to see a doctor,” said Dr. John Showalter, Jvion’s chief product officer. “Yet care teams still struggle to identify — let alone address — how these social conditions impact the health of their communities. Our collaboration with Cerner will empower more care teams with the insights they need to take meaningful action on SDOH.”

Clinicians are seeking ways to proactively treat patients more holistically and minimize healthcare inequities caused by socioeconomic drivers. Jvion’s ability to predict non-clinical risk factors is critical to meeting this need. It delivers both population health level insights for community resource planning, as well as insights on individual patients to help prevent negative outcomes such as readmissions, unplanned admissions and ED visits.

“Jvion’s expertise in aggregating, analyzing and drawing inferences from social, behavioral and other non-clinical data aligns with Cerner’s SDOH and Behavioral Health strategies and will help deliver more value to our clients,” said Kevin Seabaugh, vice president and Health Network general manager, Cerner. “Beyond just identifying high-risk patients, AI-driven insights provide a more holistic picture of the patient, including risk factors and context, enabling clinicians to take action on patient-specific recommendations to change health outcomes.”

Cerner opted for integrating Jvion models following evidence that prescriptive AI intelligence can help payers and providers deliver effective, efficient and proactive care to patients — critical to helping improve both outcomes and the overall patient experience. Last year, a peer-reviewed [study](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=RCp85bsbKav1vnbG5_FKHajUm9sE53DeFUgT_zPJ-azg_SCpFdavR1NBU6QUbWFLkBSKifl9-PahNaK_m5piHHSbNhBZ6d3yCTiS9PTg_K8=) published in _Applied Clinical Informatics_ showed that a Wisconsin hospital using Jvion’s AI insights was able to reduce readmissions by 25% over the course of six months. Meanwhile, a provider-sponsored health plan in the Midwest reduced its admissions rate by [63%](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mq1G7ZzD1MQfut8An0vpHNS3mvPYnLUHDlAfBTfa9D1O9a3v8KPqevdmxS0skgcfy0FKiI3OxLiIeDC4wkdgGPUPsGuL9NtDZcPR2qfK-mIYviUDzMjPWgSQoUfn0cR8ugSwnGG0SlUFbJU4xWH8s_4h-lHkY3438WR-ORCQQeU=) in a matched-control study, saving $528 for every successful patient outreach guided by Jvion’s prescriptive AI insights.

##### **About Jvion**

Jvion, a leader in prescriptive intelligence, leverages clinical artificial intelligence to enable providers, payers and other healthcare entities to identify and prevent avoidable patient harm, utilization and costs. An industry first, the [Jvion CORE™](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7gpvaz8BvOJ3PqUJWbU-3gSRxCxq2a9RZ4ixriHsITB-Jp32K2n-FBfvhqRuv6yJXAvPiG7O9QCiH2XD9Guyo13ld35zHjUtHvbDkff4h_A=) goes beyond predictive analytics and machine learning to identify rising risk. Jvion addresses whole patient health by surfacing the clinical and social determinants of health barriers influencing poor clinical outcomes and patient engagement. The CORE then maps the modifiable risk factors to evidence-based clinical guidance to enable decisioning within clinical and operational workflows. The Jvion CORE accelerates time to value by leveraging established patient-level intelligence to drive engagement across healthcare organizations, populations and individuals. To date, the Jvion CORE has been deployed across inpatient, ambulatory, and community settings and resulted in millions saved.
