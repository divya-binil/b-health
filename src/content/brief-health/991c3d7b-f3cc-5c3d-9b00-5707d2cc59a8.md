<p>The Rare Diseases Action Plan's 16 commitments includes the use of a digital tool to speed up diagnosis and improvements to virtual consultations.<br><br>England’s first Rare Diseases Action Plan includes the use of digital tools and virtual consultations to help ensure people with rare diseases benefit from faster diagnosis and improved access to treatment.
The action plan, published on Rare Disease Day 2022, was developed in partnership with NHS England and NHS Improvement, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Health Education England, Genomics England, the National Institute for Health Research, NHS Digital and the Medical Research Council.
It includes 16 commitments to improve the care of patients, including digital tools to support faster diagnosis, and new technology that can improve the quality of virtual consultations by enabling patients to see multiple specialists at once.</p>
