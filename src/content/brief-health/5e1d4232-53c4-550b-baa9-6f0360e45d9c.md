      The idea for Big Health was born when co-founder Peter Hames had trouble
      getting anything other than medication for his insomnia. He discovered Dr.
      Colin Espie’s book on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia, and
      realized what had worked for him could work for millions. Dr. Espie then
      became Peter’s co-founder, and together they created Big Health and its
      mission: to help millions back to good mental health.
