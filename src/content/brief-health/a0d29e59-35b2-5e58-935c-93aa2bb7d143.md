<p>The collaboration enables TribeHealth to offer its partners and their patients chronic disease management services through Engooden’s scalable, technology-enhanced solution.
Engooden Health partners with healthcare organizations of all types and sizes, bringing critical chronic disease management services to everyone from traditional fee-for-service physicians to accountable care organizations (ACOs), federally qualified health centers (FQHC), rural health clinics (RHC), and other value-based care organizations.
“Engooden’s tech-enhanced chronic disease management services allow us to build trust with patients at scale, driving clinical and financial outcomes that can help organizations better perform in value-based care,” said Ryan Atwood, VP of Payer Relations and Regulatory Compliance at Engooden Health. Engooden Health is the only company to offer scalable chronic care management (CCM) services and technology for physicians, health systems, and payers to identify rising-risk and chronically ill patients and positively impact their health trajectories.
Through technology-driven, personalized intervention by experienced and empathetic care navigators, Engooden connects with thousands of patients each month, addressing their barriers to care while helping its customers effectively manage population health and value-based care programs.</p>
