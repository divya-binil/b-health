Over in Europe, however, it is a different story, with some countries having to overcome basic issues of trust before people will even consider getting involved.</p><p>The panel on the 'Entering a New Era for Data Driven and Precision Health'&nbsp;session consisted of Zee Yoong Kang, CEO of the Health Promotion Board Singapore, Professor Kevin Fenton, London Regional Director of Public Health England, and Regional Director of Public Health for NHS London, UK, and Dr Janne Cadamuro, Laboratory physician, University Hospital Salzburg, Paracelsus Medical University, Austria, with&nbsp;Dr Charles Alessi, Chief Clinical Officer, HIMSS moderating the discussion.</p>
