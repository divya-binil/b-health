<p>Burnout is a critical issue within healthcare, therefore it is essential to take steps to preventing burnout before it becomes an issue. The healthcare industry has a long history of burnout, but the pandemic's strains brought the problem to crisis proportions. Today, employees in the healthcare industry are 3.3 times more likely to suffer burnout symptoms, such as anxiety, weariness, forgetfulness, and despair, than employees in other industries. 1 Due to their positions as people who interact with the public, efforts for reducing burnout in the healthcare industry frequently focus on doctor and nurse burnout. Yet, the administrative and HR teams' experiences inside the healthcare industry also need to be discussed. All employees are under pressure from the system, and operations and patient care are suffering significantly as a result of high sickness and exit rates brought on by burnout. Healthcare leaders must investigate new ideas to ensure the efficient and effective operation of healthcare services.</p>
