<p>The Responsible AI for Safe and Equitable Health (RAISE-Health) programme, which aims to address safety and ethical issues surrounding the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, was launched this week by Stanford Medicine and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).Stakeholders have found it difficult to define the responsible use of health AI, which has prompted some to create ethical AI standards and advocate for an evidence-based approach to the development and deployment of AI.</p><p>Others claim that cooperation is essential for the responsible deployment of health AI, which has led to the formation of alliances like the Coalition for Health AI (CHAI) and concerns about federal regulatory guidance, such as how the White House's Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights may relate to the healthcare industry.</p>
