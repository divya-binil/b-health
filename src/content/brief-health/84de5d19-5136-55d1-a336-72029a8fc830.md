<p>The international healthcare community reunited in September during the 2022 HIMSS Asia-Pacific Health Conference &amp; Exhibition in Bali, Indonesia, after a three-year hiatus following the COVID-19 epidemic. More than 1,300 experts from 35 different nations attended HIMSS22 APAC, the first HIMSS conference held in person in the Asia-Pacific area since the epidemic started. The purpose of the conference was to hasten APAC's transition to a digital healthcare system and to reaffirm industry commitment to advancing digital health for better health outcomes. It took place from September 26 to 29. 43 workshops on care, data, connection, and a brand-new track on digital excellence were included in this year's programme. HIMSS thought leaders and medical experts spoke on stage to highlight opportunities for health leaders to collaborate to advance digital health.</p>
