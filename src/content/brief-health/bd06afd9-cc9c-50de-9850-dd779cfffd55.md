<p>X-trodes, a company that offers wireless medical-grade monitoring solutions for the home environment, and EMOTIV, a bioinformatics company that is advancing understanding of the human brain using electroencephalography (EEG), today announced collaboration on a brand-new, first-of-its-kind method for simultaneous brain and physiological measurement that can be applied outside of the lab setting. The partnership combines EmotivPRO, EMOTIV's EEG data platform for neuroscience research, with the wearable sensor technology from X-trodes. Sticker-based sensors from X-trodes are particularly useful for a variety of applications where bulkier EEG equipment aren't the best fit, such sleep studies and kinesiology research. Customers of EMOTIV can now transmit user-generated data using X-trodes' exclusive dry-printed electrodes through the EmotivPRO mobile app for processing and analysis on EMOTIV's cloud-based platform.</p>
