<p>The concept is not new, but, like telehealth, at-home hospital-level services became a necessity for all health systems when acute-care beds filled during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Hospital at home became a concept that found itself in the right place at the right time, he said.
Hospital executives must first evaluate whether hospital at home for acute-level services is a good fit.
UMass Memorial Health is one academic system that launched a hospital at home program this year.
Research has shown, Larson said, that for an acute-care episode, hospital at home doesn't save a lot of money.</p>
