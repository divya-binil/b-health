<p>The American Hospital Association (AHA) made its latest foray into financing investment funds that focus on health equity with a deal involving SteelSky Ventures, a venture fund focusing on companies that improve women’s health.
“SteelSky Ventures is making critical investments in women’s health with an eye for innovation in the delivery of care,” AHA President and CEO Rick Pollack said in a statement.
Back in January, AHA partnered with Jumpstart Nova, which invests only in Black-founded healthcare companies that are primarily in the health IT, digital and medical device spaces as well as the consumer health and wellness sectors.</p>
