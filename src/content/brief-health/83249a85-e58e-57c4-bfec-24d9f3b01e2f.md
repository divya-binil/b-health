<p>The study also found that applying a federated learning approach can further improve accuracy of the model.<br>A study has demonstrated the international transferability of a Taiwanese artificial intelligence model for detecting medication errors in EHR systems in the United States.</p><p>The study was jointly conducted by Taiwan-based medical AI startup Aesop Technology, Taipei Medical University, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. Its results were announced last week in a press release.</p><p><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong></p><p>The "biggest challenge" in data-driven medicine is the successful implementation of data-driven applications in clinical practice from local to global settings without compromising patient safety and privacy, according to Dr Yu-Chuan Jack Li, a professor at Taipei Medical University.</p><p>The study, whose findings were published in the <a href="https://medinform.jmir.org/2021/1/e23454/">Journal of Medical Internet Research - Medical Informatics</a> in January, found "good" transferability of Aesop's machine learning model in the EHR systems of two training schools under Harvard Medical School – Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital.</p><p><br><a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/apac/study-finds-success-using-taiwanese-medication-safety-ai-model-us-ehr-systems">Read on mobihealthnews.com</a></p>
