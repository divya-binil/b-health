<p>Although the vaccine’s rollout is slowly underway, Covid cases worldwide are continuing to reach all-time highs as new mutations make the virus even more contagious than ever before. Not surprisingly, patients’ concerns about visiting their healthcare providers in the midst of this global pandemic persist, pushing demand for telehealth solutions that allow patients and their doctors to communicate without the need for in-person visits.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, a recent <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality">report</a> from McKinsey found that physicians and other health professionals were seeing 50 to 175 times the number of patients via telehealth than they did pre-pandemic, and that going forward, these types of virtual visits could account for $250 billion (or about 20%) of what Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurers spend on outpatient, office and home health visits. This of course is good news for the providers of these technologies. However, the same can’t be said for healthcare facilities’ own revenue streams.&nbsp;</p><p>The truth is, healthcare practices have been under immense pressure financially since the onset of Covid-19. A recent <a href="https://mgma.com/getattachment/9b8be0c2-0744-41bf-864f-04007d6adbd2/2004-G09621D-COVID-Financial-Impact-One-Pager-8-5x11-MW-2.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US&amp;ext=.pdf">MGMA report</a> found that 97% have experienced a negative financial impact related to the pandemic, and over half (55%) saw a decrease in revenue in the early months of the crisis. But with the vaccine’s rollout set to scale in the spring, and thus require those receiving it to visit their doctor’s office in-person for what might be their first time in over a year, it’s vital that providers find ways to instill enough confidence in their patients to get them in through their doors.&nbsp;</p>
