<p>Canadian health AI company NuraLogix has introduced its mobile health measurement app in Singapore. Anura uses proprietary transdermal optical imaging technology, which captures blood information from a person's face through a video camera. It can measure various vital parameters, including blood pressure, heart rate, stress level, cardiac workload, and risk of heart attack and stroke. The facial blood flow data is then processed via cloud where an AI engine called DeepAffex applies advanced signal processing and deep learning to predict physiological and psychological affects.Standigm, an AI drug discovery company in South Korea, has signed a memorandum of understanding with life science firm Merck Korea for AI-driven drug discovery research.
Based on a media release, the partnership involves Standigm's adoption of Merck's AI software SYNTHIA for compound synthesis.</p>
