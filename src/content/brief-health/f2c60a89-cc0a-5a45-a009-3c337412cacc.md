<p>Edifecs, Inc., a global health information technology solutions company, today announced a new solution that fully automates prior authorization at the point of care, leading to improved member experiences, enhanced outcomes, ongoing compliance, and reduced administrative burden.
Edifecs’ automated prior authorization solution integrates with electronic health records (EHR) and leverages artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), and industry standards such as FHIR to instantly deliver authorization. With its recent acquisition of Talix and Health Fidelity, Edifecs expanded its risk adjustment business, AI technology, and EHR integration capabilities and is uniquely positioned to transform the prior authorization process.
By leveraging industry standards like FHIR and over 40 payer implementations for patient access, Edifecs’ prior authorization solution significantly reduces the time to care through EHR-agnostic integration with providers.
Edifecs is a frontrunner in bringing new technology for B2B data exchange in healthcare streamlining business processes from “card to care,” and reducing the industry burden associated with data provisioning at the points of enrollment, care, payment, and reporting.</p>
