title: Florida Blue first health plan to sign on for integrated Teladoc-Livongo platform
---

Florida Blue is expanding its partnership with Teladoc to add Livongo's virtual diabetes solution for its members.

It's the first health plan to sign on for the integrated technology platform as a result of Teladoc's proposed $18.5 billion acquisition of Livongo, a company that provides diabetes monitoring and remote monitoring. 

Florida Blue, a subsidiary of GuideWell Mutual Holding Corp. and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan of Florida, currently offers Teladoc Healthâ€™s virtual care program to its members and will expand its virtual services to provide access to Livongo for Diabetes to select members, the company said.
