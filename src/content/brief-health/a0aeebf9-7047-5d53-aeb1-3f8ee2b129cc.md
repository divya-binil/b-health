<p>Independent physicians know two things: they need to provide good medical care and patient service in order for their practice to succeed while also needing to manage the business side of their practice so it remains competitive and grows.

Dedication and support of a cause or local community event can help raise awareness and increase visibility of the practice, as well as the important medical and health care issues that physicians support.</p>
