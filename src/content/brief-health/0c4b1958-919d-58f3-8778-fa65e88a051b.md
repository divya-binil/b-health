<p>A new joint project has been started by gut health and probiotic company <a href="https://seed.com/">Seed</a> and AI company <a href="https://www.auggi.ai/">Auggi</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The two companies are <a href="https://seed.com/poop/">asking people to take photos of their poop</a> and to (anonymously) upload them to their online database. Then, Auggi will use machine learning to teach their algorithm the difference between healthy and unhealthy poop, and (eventually) use that data to offer up solutions to those with GI probs. The campaign, amazingly enough, is called #GiveAShit. (For science.)<br><br><a href="https://www.wellandgood.com/good-advice/whats-normal-poop-seed/">Read on wellandgood.com</a></p>
