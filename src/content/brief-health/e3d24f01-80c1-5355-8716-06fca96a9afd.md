<p>According to new research published in Nature Biotechnology, artificial intelligence (AI) can forecast on- and off-target behavior of CRISPR tools that target RNA rather than DNA. The New York Genome Centre, Columbia Engineering, and New York University study uses a deep learning model and CRISPR screens to control the expression of human genes in various ways, similar to turning a light switch to completely turn them off or turning a dim switch to partially reduce their activity. New CRISPR-based treatments could be created using these precise gene controls. CRISPR is a gene-editing technology with numerous applications in biomedicine and elsewhere, ranging from curing sickle cell anemia to creating mustard greens with improved flavour.&nbsp;</p>
