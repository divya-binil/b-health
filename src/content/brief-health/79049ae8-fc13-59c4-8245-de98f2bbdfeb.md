<p>Analytics software from global data leader Qlik is set to be deployed across one of England's largest National Health Service (NHS) trusts, Barts Health, in a move that it is hoped will transform the way they deliver patient care across their five London hospitals.&nbsp;</p><p>The application, WeInform, is powered by the Qlik Sense® data analytics platform. It will be available to all 16,000 Barts Health employees who will be able to access data via a mobile device from anywhere in the hospital, enabling them to refer to recent patient insights before making clinical decisions.&nbsp;</p>
