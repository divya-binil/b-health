<p>In particular, the potential of AI to transform drug development and patient care is unparalleled – its ability to gather objective insights can help elevate a clinical trial’s data and bring potentially life-saving drugs to people in need faster.
To ensure AI doesn’t unintentionally perpetuate human biases and put minority populations at a disadvantage, the industry must work together to help AI reach its greatest potential.
We need to be wary of this, as today’s AI developers still consistently lack access to large, diverse data sets and often train algorithms on small, single-origin data samples with limited diversity.</p>
