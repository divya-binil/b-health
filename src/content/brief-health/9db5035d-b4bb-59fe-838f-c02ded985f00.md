<p>"When we talk about virtual care, think hybrid," he told Healthcare IT News in a wide-ranging interview about the future of telemedicine.<br><br>It's been a busy few years for virtual care, to say the least. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, companies <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/amazon-confirms-nationwide-expansion-telehealth-services">have elbowed their way</a> into a seemingly flush market, while patient interest in telehealth has <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/teladoc-unitedhealthcare-get-high-marks-jd-power-telehealth-study">waxed and waned</a>.</p><p>Now, many patients and providers are asking: What will telehealth look like five or ten years from now? How do we go beyond synchronous video visits – and <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/telehealths-digital-divide-real-and-members-congress-want-address-it">how do we ensure equitable access</a> to whatever improvements are made available?</p><p>Claus Jensen, chief innovation officer at Teladoc Health, says the question isn't just about what other kinds of healthcare can be made virtual. It's also about using clinical, technical and logistical tools to help patients make the best health decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Jensen spoke with <i>Healthcare IT News</i> about what he sees as the future of telemedicine, how the decades-old giant has dealt with scrappy newcomers and what's on the horizon for the company.</p>
