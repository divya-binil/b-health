<p>Forward Advantage is excited to announce the availability of PXMobile, a new mobile app platform designed in close collaboration with MEDITECH.
PXMobile is a healthcare system branded app platform that integrates with leading EHRs and other third-party solutions to seamlessly and consistently deliver the most relevant and important information to patients.
PXMobile is the first to offer deep integration with MEDITECH's patient portal, allowing hospitals to embed portal functionality directly within their own branded app.
"This collaboration with MEDITECH resulted in a secure platform that puts a hospital's brand at the center, while integrating with the EHR to deliver the information that's important to their specific patient population."
