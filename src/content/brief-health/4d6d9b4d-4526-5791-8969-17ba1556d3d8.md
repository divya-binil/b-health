<p>This month we’ve been focused on covering a number of topics related to the <a href="https://www.healthcareittoday.com/tag/healthcare-cloud/">healthcare cloud</a>.&nbsp; Needless to say, it’s been one of the most important technologies during COVID-19 as many healthcare organizations had to scale up in so many areas.&nbsp; In most cases, cloud solutions was the key to being able to scale effectively.</p><p>As we wanted to dive deeper into the topic, we decided to turn to the company that literally has a cloud as their logo.&nbsp; Plus, it’s a company that has made a lot of inroads into healthcare over the past couple years.&nbsp; That company is Salesforce and we were privileged to sit down with Dr. Geeta Nayyar, Executive Medical Director and General Manager, Healthcare and Life Sciences at <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/solutions/industries/healthcare/overview/">Salesforce</a>.</p><p>Dr. G is a long time friend of Healthcare IT Today and so along with talking about cloud in healthcare we briefly talk about fashion choices and missing events.&nbsp; Plus, Dr. G shares some great insights into the advantages and disadvantages of cloud in healthcare and the role cloud played for many healthcare organizations during COVID.</p><p>We also ask Dr. G how Salesforce’s cloud solutions can help a healthcare organization connect with patients at scale and why that’s important going forward.&nbsp; Plus, we dive into the topic of cloud security and how healthcare organizations feel about cloud solutions from a security perspective and how that’s changed over time.</p>
