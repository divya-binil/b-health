<p>In <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/category/health-it/">healthcare technology</a>, there’s no such thing as a silver bullet solution, and each technology has its benefits and its limitation.&nbsp;<a href="https://hitconsultant.net/category/emr-ehr/">Electronic health records (EHRs)</a>&nbsp;are no exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On their own,&nbsp;EHRs&nbsp;provide insight into a patient’s visit history, medical background, and more, but when used in combination with other innovative, user-friendly technologies, clinicians’ experience with EHRs will only improve.&nbsp;One of the easiest—and most significant—ways that&nbsp;clinicians&nbsp;can begin to augment the existing&nbsp;information&nbsp;EHRs&nbsp;offer&nbsp;is to also&nbsp;simultaneously&nbsp;utilize medical reference&nbsp;platforms that leverage mobile applications and web-based resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Doing so goes&nbsp;a step further to provide physicians&nbsp;with clinical guidance that’s similar to asking a colleague&nbsp;for a “gut check.”&nbsp;There&nbsp;are&nbsp;a few reasons why, when&nbsp;used&nbsp;in combination, these two tools can dramatically enhance a physician’s ability to deliver the highest-quality&nbsp;care&nbsp;that enhances the clinician-patient relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
