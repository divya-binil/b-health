<p>Imaging technologies are continuously improving. In some cases, imaging advancement allows for enhanced diagnostics, such as using a CT scan<br><br>In particular, their benefits are being showcased in the blood work field to expedite the blood drawing or IV placement experience and reduce patient discomfort.
One of the most common complaints when receiving blood work is the number of tries it takes to get the needle into the vein.
To help make the process of blood drawing smoother, vein visualizers provide a way for phlebotomists to see the veins more easily.
One auspicious method of vein visualization utilizes near-infrared imaging technology, which is commonly used in smartwatches to measure blood oxygen saturation.
By making the needle placement process easier and faster through the usage of vein finders, the experience of these patients improves; they don’t experience as much pain, discomfort, and agitation.</p>
