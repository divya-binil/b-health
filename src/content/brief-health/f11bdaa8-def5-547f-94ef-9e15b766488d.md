<p>For about a decade, <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/category/digital-health-2/">digital health </a>has been slowly winning the battle against healthcare’s slow pace of change. Digital found an unexpected ally in <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/coronavirus-covid-19/">Covid</a>, as the pandemic forced health systems to adopt virtual solutions wholesale.&nbsp;</p><p>As we start to come out on the other side, though, some health systems are contemplating returning to the status quo, especially as they’re feeling acute financial strain.</p><p>The majority, however, understand that the pandemic constitutes a sea change in the industry — that there is no more status quo. Competitors are rising up to take the place (and the patients) of health systems who aren’t willing to play by the new stakes.</p><p>These competitors are no longer just the health systems down the street, but non-traditional, venture backed organizations that are establishing stand-alone clinics with their own networks of providers — offering patients what they call “direct primary care” and targeting specific populations.&nbsp;</p>
