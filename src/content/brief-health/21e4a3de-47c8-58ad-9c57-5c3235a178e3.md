<p>Patients feel rushed and less empathetic care when doctors are burned out, but technology can mitigate some of the effects. According to a recent poll, approximately two thirds of participants reported symptoms of burnout, which indicates that physicians are becoming increasingly stressed and burned out. Physician burnout can have a negative effect on patients' capacity to navigate the health care system in addition to having an adverse effect on the health and wellbeing of the doctors themselves. When burnout results in hurried consultations, less sympathetic patient interactions, and longer wait times, it can have an adverse influence on the entire practise. Patients may feel disheartened and hesitant to seek care when necessary as a result of all of these issues. The proper practise technology implementation can not only lessen these impacts but also empower patients to manage their own care. Patients observe the technology their medical professionals employ.</p>
