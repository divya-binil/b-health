<p>In 2022, the FDA (Federal Food and Drug Administration) will clear or approve over 1,000 medical devices.
Here’s a breakdown of some of the most anticipated otc medical devices that have already received FDA approval.
Some of these new FDA medical devices will truly impress you.
FDA list of medical devices approved in 2022
The Food and Drug Administration sets standards for safety and is responsible for ensuring that all medical devices sold in the United States are effective.
Each year, thousands of new devices are introduced to the market, and the FDA must review and approve each one before it can be made available to consumers to make sure there aren’t any risks.
According to a report from the FDA, approximately 25 percent of medical devices that are submitted for approval each year are denied.
If a device is denied FDA approval, it cannot be sold in the United States.
However, these five innovative devices have managed to get FDA approval and are now readily available to improve the lifestyle quality of their users.
The Prometra Programmable Infusion Pump System is a medical device that is used to deliver medications and other fluids into a patient’s body in a controlled and accurate manner.
If you are in the public healthcare or medical device industry, it is important to keep up with the latest FDA approvals and clearances.
This year is shaping up to be an exciting year for medical device developments, with many new products cleared or approved by the FDA.
Be sure to stay tuned as we continue to update this FDA medical device certification list throughout the year.
