<p>The transition is part of a larger effort to fully integrate Kindred at Home's home-health operations into Humana. Health insurer Humana is adding 14 states to its ongoing initiative to rebrand the home health division of Kindred at Home as CenterWell Home Health.
Humana introduced the CenterWell Home Health brand, along with the first phase of transitioning the home health division of Kindred at Home, on March 1.
The rebranded Kindred at Home locations will now display new interior and exterior signage reflecting the CenterWell Home Health brand.
The introduction of CenterWell Home Health is part of a larger effort to brand all of Humana's payer-agnostic healthcare service offerings – open to patients with a variety of health plans, not just Humana – under the name CenterWell.</p>
