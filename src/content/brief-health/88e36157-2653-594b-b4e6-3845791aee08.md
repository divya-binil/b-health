<p>A new KLAS report shows hospital executives consistently describing two technology factors as key to their progress with population health and shared savings: strong integration and timely customization.<br><br>A new report from the KLAS <a href="https://klasresearch.com/report/phm-downside-risk-2021/1388">analytics firm</a> examined the role downside risk contracts can play when it comes to improving outcomes and saving money. &nbsp;</p><p>By working with population health management vendors, KLAS explored the ways organizations can use technology and buy-in to make "significant progress" toward value-based reimbursement. &nbsp;</p><p>"Success with downside risk requires a lot of effort from provider organizations and their vendor partners, and both parties must be willing to put in the necessary work," observed researchers. "Leading organizations have collaborative relationships with their IT vendors and work in tandem with them to develop needed technology." &nbsp;</p><p>"In some cases, organizations supply data to help train models, or they may develop functionality internally that is then integrated into the technology platform. This kind of development requires heavy internal investment from the provider organization," they added.</p>
