<p>Epic representatives gave a sneak peek at the company's plans for the HIMSS22 Conference and Exhibition this March – including the announcement of Cheers, a new customer relationship management system. &nbsp;</p><p>"The booth will show off how healthcare organizations can use Cheers to help folks shopping or looking for care, complete an easy intake process, access direct care and remain engaged outside the four walls of a health system," said Sam Seering, a member of the implementation services – CRM team at Epic. &nbsp;</p><p>"We’ll demonstrate how Cheers weaves together tens of thousands of data elements and validated insights to help systems know their populations, anticipate their needs and help them navigate their health journeys through omnichannel experiences," Seering added. &nbsp;</p><p>The booth will also offer attendees the chance to review the latest reports from Epic research, which uses its <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/judy-faulkner-talks-lessons-learned-epics-covid-19-response">Cosmos database</a> to glean insights about patient populations. &nbsp;</p><p>"We just published a report that answers the question of how likely you are to acquire COVID-19 from a hospital admission," said Dr. Jackie Gerhart, lead clinician for Epic Research, referencing a <a href="https://epicresearch.org/articles/fears-of-catching-covid-19-in-a-hospital-likely-unfounded">brief from Monday.</a> &nbsp;</p><p>"Prior to that, Cosmos data was used to expedite the decision to approve Moderna and J+J boosters and in the decision to [approve] vaccinations in 5- to 11-year-olds," she said. &nbsp;</p>
