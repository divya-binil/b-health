<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has uprooted voters' lives and may shape the way they cast their ballots Tuesday.</p><p>Some eight months in, the novel coronavirus has so far <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">killed more than 230,000 Americans</a>, with cases rapidly rising as flu season begins.
