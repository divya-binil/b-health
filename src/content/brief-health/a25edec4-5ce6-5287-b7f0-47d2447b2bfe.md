<p>Cyber-attacks against the healthcare sector have been making headlines lately, ranging from attacks on coronavirus drug makers to telehealth and IoT devices. One of the largest medical cyberattacks in U.S. history occurred in September when Universal Health Services was hit with what appears to be a ransomware attack, affecting the company’s 400+ locations for several days. The hospital system’s medication system was all online, making treatment difficult. The staff had to revert to using pen and paper, including hand-labeling medicines, which isn’t just arduous and inefficient; it also increases the potential for mistakes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
