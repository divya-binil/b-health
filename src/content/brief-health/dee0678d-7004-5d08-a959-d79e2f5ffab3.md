<p>Singaporean health tech startup Mesh Bio and UK-based drug discovery firm MultiOmic Health have started collaborating to build a huge multi-omics dataset that will provide insights into metabolic syndrome-related conditions among Asians.
The large multi-omics dataset they are building will enable the companies to advance their respective R&amp;D programmes to develop precision therapeutic and diagnostic products for patients with metabolic syndrome-related conditions.
"Longitudinal multi-omics data combined with deep clinical phenotyping is essential to developing transformative therapeutics and diagnostics in chronic multi-factorial diseases," said Angeli MÃ¶ller, vice-chairperson and co-founder of the global advocacy group Alliance for Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare.</p>
