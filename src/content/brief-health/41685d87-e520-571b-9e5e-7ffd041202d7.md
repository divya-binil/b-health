<p>So to help you through this transition into the new ways of working, we have compiled a list of books to help leaders in healthcare keep up with the new workforce culture as we approach a new era after the pandemic.
With COVID-19, leadership teams now must address these contemporary and dynamic ways of working within their organizations to ensure that employees, customers and other stakeholders are supported and their needs are met.
On our list, you will find books addressing topics including digital healthcare transformation, considerations for health design and how leaders can connect with employees to improve the well-being for themselves and the medical community during these challenging times.
Based on interviews with over 150 executives in leading health systems, this book offers a foundational framework for organizations and taps into how digital healthcare is pushing the boundaries of innovation.
As this transformation continues, leaders need to become aware of how these advances can improve the healthcare industry.
This book provides innovators with ways to connect healthcare with the patient for the best possible outcomes.
This book discusses ways to prevent customer defection, which can be adapted to the healthcare industry and improve the patient experience.
Gaining insights from other industries is a great way for healthcare leaders to think outside of the box.
This book is based on interviews and insights from stakeholders and thought leaders in the healthcare industry discussing how innovation is changing the field of medicine.
The pandemic has completely changed the way we work, so leaders need to reevaluate their organizational strategies, ensuring that their teams are being supported and included.
These books will give you, as healthcare leaders, insights into how to positively change the dynamics of your team so that you can stay ahead of the curve and bring lasting improvements not only to your employees but to the patients they serve.</p>
