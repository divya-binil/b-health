<p>Doctors and patients can communicate digitally in real-time through phone, video chat, as well as streaming. RTE also helps mental health experts conduct remote sessions with patients - thanks to clear audio, fluid real-time video, and integrated functionality. Agoraâ€™s real-time engagement platform provides a global reach, dependable streaming, and real-time interactions for remote medical consultation, video, first aid, interactive medical education, and large-scale event streaming. With the help of the technology developed, patients can communicate with their therapist through live video, audio, or text at any time from the comfort of their homes. With voice, video chat, and live streaming, doctors and patients are virtually brought together in real time. Capabilities like crystal-clear audio, smooth, real-time video, and integrated functionalities allow patients to share their medical records, doctors to review medical imaging scans, or mental health professionals to conduct remote sessions with patients. Every aspect of the healthcare system is incorporating more digital technology, as we talk about, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and robots. More medical institutions need to be prepared to upgrade their digital infrastructure with newer technologies like AI, ML, IoT, robots, AR, VR, and others to improve patient care, data analysis, and healthcare practices. Technology like AR and VR have also seen massive adoption in industries like healthcare.</p>
