<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) urges caution while employing large language model tools (LLMs) produced by artificial intelligence (AI) in order to protect and enhance human well-being, human safety, and human autonomy, as well as to preserve public health.</p><p>Some of the most rapidly growing platforms that mimic comprehending, processing, and creating human communication are LLMs, including ChatGPT, Bard, Bert, and many others. Significant enthusiasm is being generated about their ability to meet people's health demands as a result of their rapid public dissemination and expanding experimental application for health-related purposes. To safeguard people's health and lessen inequality, it is essential to carefully consider the hazards associated with utilizing LLMs to increase access to health information, as a decision-support tool, or even to improve diagnostic capability in settings with limited resources.</p>
