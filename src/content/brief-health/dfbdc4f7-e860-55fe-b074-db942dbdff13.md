<p>Patient scheduling can be a complex and time-consuming task. Schedulers working the phones to line up patient visits take&nbsp;an average of eight minutes&nbsp;to nail down each appointment. A full-time worker dedicated to this task might schedule around 50 appointments a day.</p><p>With the rise of the demanding consumer in the 21st century, effective patient scheduling means&nbsp;<i>self-scheduling</i>. Patients are ready for this shift, most have already experienced self-scheduling and most prefer that their provider offers this option. For many patients, the ability to use patient self-scheduling may even be the deciding factor in choosing a doctor.</p><p>Thankfully, self-scheduling automation technology has arrived, promising less time-consuming ways to schedule, allowing patients to schedule on their own time conveniently. This approach means you can dedicate more of your employeeâ€™s time to focus on serving new patients or complex, multi-part appointments rather than chasing existing patients who need a simple follow-up appointment.</p>
