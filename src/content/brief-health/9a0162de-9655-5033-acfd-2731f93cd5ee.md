<p>Hyland and Vantari VR have also announced key senior appointments. Stuart Bloomfield, chief digital officer of Waitematā and Counties Manukau District Health Boards, has temporarily been appointed to the role of chief of data and digital at the interim Health NZ.
Content services provider Hyland has appointed a former official from technology consulting firm Gartner as its senior manager for the company's Asia-Pacific healthcare division.
"His personal mission to democratise access to healthcare training internationally with the transformative technology of virtual reality aligns with our goals for Vantari VR, and we’re excited about what the future holds for us with Jay’s expertise," Vantari VR co-CEO and co-founder Nishanth Krishnananthan said about his appointment.
Commenting on his new role, Kahlon said: "The vision Vantari has laid out utilising virtual reality to enable access to world-class clinical procedural training, regardless of educator availability, simulation space and self-directed learning has greatly resonated with how I envision our collaboration can disrupt the status quo of access to world-class healthcare training".</p>
