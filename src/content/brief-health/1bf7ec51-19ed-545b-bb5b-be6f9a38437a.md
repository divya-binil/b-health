<p>New Mexico health system will deploy Commure Strongline system across 70 buildings to enable clinicians and staff under duress to instantly call for help. Commure, Inc. today announced that Presbyterian Healthcare Services of Albuquerque, New Mexico, will deploy the Commure Strongline staff safety system across Presbyterian's entire enterprise, which encompasses 7,000 workers in 70 buildings.
Commure Strongline is a powerful and portable duress-alerting solution that can be easily installed to create safer care environments, help protect clinicians and staff, and ultimately improve engagement and retention.
By introducing new tools like Commure Strongline, we can help our teams worry less about their safety and focus even more on delivering great care," said Tim Johnsen, chief operating officer, Presbyterian Delivery System.
"There's increasing recognition that the COVID-19 pandemic masked the epidemic of workplace violence in healthcare," said Howard Grant, M.D., retired president and CEO of Lahey Clinic and Health System near Boston, and a strategic advisor to Commure Strongline.</p>
