<p>The shift to value-based healthcare means practices are feeling the pressure to improve their patient engagement and retention. With competition from other practices, “minute” clinics, urgent care centers, and health systems, patients have more choice than ever.

In fact, <a href="https://www.solutionreach.com/wp-banner-ten-ways-to-attract-new-patients?hsCtaTracking=3ef4dfc7-89d4-43d4-ba28-7ae1ce5041a7%7C3eaab374-1a40-44cd-a6e6-3ea8f29be504">54 percent</a> of Millennials have done just that in the past two years, and 42 percent are likely to switch in the coming two years. How can providers work to proactively combat these high attrition rates? Not surprisingly, the <a href="https://www.solutionreach.com/wp-banner-ten-ways-to-attract-new-patients?hsCtaTracking=3ef4dfc7-89d4-43d4-ba28-7ae1ce5041a7%7C3eaab374-1a40-44cd-a6e6-3ea8f29be504">top items</a> on patients’ wish lists for the ideal doctor are greater connectivity and convenience through online tools — both things that are easy for a practice to implement using patient relationship management (PRM) solutions.</p>
