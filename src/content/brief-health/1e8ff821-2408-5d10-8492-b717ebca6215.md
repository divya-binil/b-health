<p>An article from Summit Talent Group, a Columbia, Md.-based boutique executive search and interim leadership placement firm, lists various ways an interim leader can help hospitals.
He also said that in rare cases where the interim leader is well-known to the organization, highly trusted and without ulterior motives, they can act as a good stabilizer for an organization in crisis.
Jennifer Grennan, executive vice president and chief administrative officer of Sioux Falls, S.D.-based Sanford Health, told Becker's her organization has long recognized the crucial role leaders play.
In 2018, Mr. Bury was nearing the end of his career, but a leader was needed for the Good Samaritan Society after the nonprofit provider of senior care and services merged with Sanford, Ms. Grennan said.
Regarding this viewpoint, Ms. Grennan said "thoughtful, deliberate and strategic internal succession planning for a president and CEO role is designed to help ensure that when a transition occurs, whether planned or unplanned, the organization is well positioned to continue to advance its mission and lead its people and the communities it serves." 
"For example, when our CIO vacated the role in early 2021, rather than naming an interim leader or a permanent replacement immediately, we decided it would be best to identify a leader among leaders to make sure the work and collaboration continued while we conducted an executive search to identify the strongest internal and external candidates," she said.
In contrast, Ms. Grennan said one challenge with interim leadership roles is they may offer a limited ability to influence or make decisions.
"Interim leaders sometimes feel like they are in a perpetual job interview, which can create uncertainty, diminish trust within an organization and put business continuity at risk," she said.
Sanford Health believes in the importance of deliberate succession planning at all levels of the organization to ensure we have the right leaders in the right places to meet the needs of our patients and communities for years to come."</p>
