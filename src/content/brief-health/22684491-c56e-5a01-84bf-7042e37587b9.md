<p>Lyle Berkowitz&nbsp;is a physician executive. He shares his story and discusses his KevinMD article, "What consumers want from telehealth." Join us for a thought-provoking discussion with physician executive Lyle Berkowitz as he addresses the expanding telehealth trend and its effects on patient care. Consumers are understanding the usefulness and convenience of telehealth for minor urgent situations, chronic disease management, and mental health care as the COVID-19 epidemic accelerates the usage of virtual visits. Dr. Berkowitz will discuss the findings of a recent consumer survey, which revealed that a resounding majority of respondents thought it was crucial for their regular doctor and telehealth provider to have access to their medical records in order to share crucial information. He will also go over the difficulties that health systems have in gaining access to telehealth, including the significance of relationships with online care providers, seamless data exchange, and developing a telehealth infrastructure.</p>
