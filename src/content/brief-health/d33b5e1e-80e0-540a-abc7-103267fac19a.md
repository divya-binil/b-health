<p>As we close out the year, we asked several healthcare industry executives to share their predictions and trends for 2021.<br><br><strong>Kimberly Powell, Vice President &amp; General Manager, NVIDIA Healthcare</strong></p><p><strong>Federated Learning:</strong>&nbsp;The clinical community will increase their use of&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/10/13/what-is-federated-learning/">federated learning approaches</a>&nbsp;to build robust AI models across various institutions, geographies, patient demographics, and medical scanners. The sensitivity and selectivity of these models are outperforming AI models built at a single institution, even when there is copious data to train with. As an added bonus, researchers can collaborate on AI model creation without sharing confidential patient information. Federated learning is also beneficial for building AI models for areas where data is scarce, such as for pediatrics and rare diseases.</p>
