<p>One key concern is that the technology will diminish personal connections between patients and providers, a survey from the Pew Research Center found. Many industries, including healthcare, are gradually adopting AI tools to streamline workflows and processes, but consumers are largely opposed to professionals utilising these tools when providing care, according to a Pew Research Center survey. According to the poll, which comprised responses from more than 11,000 U.S. consumers gathered in December, a major worry is the possibility that AI tools could weaken interpersonal interactions between patients and clinicians. People worry that the security of their medical records may deteriorate. Yet, respondents noted possible advantages, such as how AI might lower the frequency of mistakes made by providers. Despite the fact that the technology has been accused of making racial and ethnic biases in healthcare settings worse, they nevertheless voiced hope about AI's potential impact on this problem.</p>
