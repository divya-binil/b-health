<p>The Louisiana health system performed more than 300,000 virtual visits in 2020 and earned a Net Promoter Score of 87.5 out of 100 – better than Amazon and Netflix.<br><br>At New Orleans-based Ochsner Health, patients are priority No. 1, and they serve as a compass for what staff does. Ochsner's digital health programs began as solutions for the health system itself and for its communities.&nbsp;However, the health system quickly expanded the programs to consumers, employers and payers with the goal of applying innovation to healthcare gaps in access to care and specialty expertise.</p><p>Telehealth at Ochsner began more than a decade ago with a pediatric echocardiogram program to help bridge a gap of geographic and specialty disparity across the state of Louisiana. There simply were not enough pediatric cardiologists to treat the rural population.</p><p>Over the next 10 years, hospital-based programs in telehealth for stroke, psychiatry and ICU were developed with partnerships across several states. And Ochsner has made significant investments over the last four years in building out direct-to-consumer telemedicine care delivery.</p>
