This morning PerfectServe, a Tennessee-based medical communication and collaboration platform, announced two new acquisitions in the digital health space. The first is CareWire, which is a mobile patient communication platform. The second is Lightning Bolt Solutions, an artificial intelligence-run physician shift scheduling technology designed for hospital and healthcare system. 

CareWire can enable texting between patients and providers, and allow the former to schedule appointments and connect to their healthcare portal. The platform takes into account social determinants of health and will send different messages depending on the patients social circumstances. The platform is also able to capture patient and provider interactions and send them to the provider’s EHR system, according to its website.
