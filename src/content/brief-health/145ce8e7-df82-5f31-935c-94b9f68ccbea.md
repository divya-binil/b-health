<p>Considering the size and scope of Alphabet, it should be little surprise that the company and its subsidiaries (Google, Google Cloud and Verily, to name a few) have become deeply ingrained in the healthcare ecosystem over the last several years.</p><p>The tech giant maintained the momentum in 2020 with efforts focused on artificial intelligence, data flow and digital clinical research – and also sought to tackle the curveball of COVID-19 through community testing centers, contact tracing APIs, population-level behavior analyses and more.</p><p>Not to be lost in the mix is that pending acquisition of health wearable-maker Fitbit&nbsp;(which has been grappling with regulators throughout the better part of the year),&nbsp;or the launch of a new health insurance venture targeting self-funded employers.<br>&nbsp;</p>
