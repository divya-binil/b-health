<p>Today a patient's ZIP code can say a lot about their life expectancy and health outcomes. In the U.S. especially, healthcare costs are high, leaving some without access to care. This has left innovators to look to digital as a way to help in scaling&nbsp;care and lowering costs. Big tech especially is jumping into the healthcare game.</p><p>During a panel at the <a href="https://live.vaticanconference2021.org/en/hall#topics-tab">Vatican Conference</a> on health this morning, Dr. David Feinberg, vice president and head of Google Health, and Dr. Mark McClellan, director of the Robert J. Margolis Center for Health Policy, discussed how tech could help expand access to health and assist clinicians in providing better care.</p>
