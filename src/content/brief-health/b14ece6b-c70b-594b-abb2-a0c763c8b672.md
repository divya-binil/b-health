<p>During a conversation with George Valentine, Cox Communications' Assistant Vice President of New Growth and Development, we explored the impact of connected hospitals on smart communities. George Valentine highlights the potential of IoT in improving hospital operations and discusses the benefits of automation and process streamlining. By leveraging IoT technology, hospitals can achieve higher-level operational insights and enhance asset management, allowing for the harmonization of traditionally compartmentalized processes. This advancement enables the C-suite to gain a comprehensive understanding of hospital operations and make more informed decisions.</p>
