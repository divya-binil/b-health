<p>An oncologist administering nanorobots that swim through a patient’s bloodstream to deliver drugs in a highly targeted way. A person on a specific diet scanning their meal with a single device to reveal all of its major nutritional elements. A clinic’s transplant department 3D-printing whole organs. These are scenarios that sound like snippets extracted from a science-fiction novel. But these are digital health technologies that we will have to get used to in the future.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/nanotechnology-in-medicine/">Nanorobots</a>, <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/the-future-of-food-the-food-of-the-future/">food scanners</a>, and <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/3d-bioprinting-overview/">bioprinting</a> are all existing digital health technologies that we’ve reported on The Medical Futurist. However, they are in the “too futuristic” category (even for The Medical Futurist!) as the future where they will be commonplace is several decades away and is something we might not even be around to experience.</p><p>They are too futuristic not only because the underlying technology is still in its infancy, but also because the digital health field faces several challenges that must overcome before addressing those technologies.</p><p>Here we contemplate some of those too futuristic digital health technologies that won’t get in the doctor’s room or in a patient’s home any time soon, how far off in the future they are and what needs to happen before we get to see them in practice.</p>
