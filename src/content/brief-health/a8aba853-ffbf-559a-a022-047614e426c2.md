<p>The <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/coronavirus-covid-19/">COVID-19 pandemic</a> has transformed how we interact with one another, with businesses, and with the world around us. From social distancing to hand sanitation to remote working, its impact on society is immense. And among the various industries that are experiencing significant change as a result of the pandemic, healthcare tops the list. Supply chain disruptions, crowded ICUs and exhausted medical staff has taken a toll on hospitals and clinics — and they’ve had to pivot rapidly to new processes and procedures to continue delivering quality care and keeping operating costs in check.</p><p>Amid all the disruption, alternative care delivery methods such as telehealth, virtual care, and in-home care have emerged as viable options for mitigating many of the challenges of the pandemic. Whereas in the past, these methods had trouble gaining traction among healthcare consumers, adoption is accelerating. In many cases, these alternative care delivery options are the preferred way to receive medical care. In short, the site of care is shifting and will continue to shift away from hospitals and clinical locations.</p>
