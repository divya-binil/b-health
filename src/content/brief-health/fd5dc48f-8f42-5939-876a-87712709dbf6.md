<p>The new accelerator will offer ten startups a chance to participate in a four-week training and mentorship program.<br><br>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is creating a new accelerator aimed at the digital health space that will give 10 startups operating in the U.S. a four-week crash course in technical training and&nbsp;business development, and includes a mentorship component.</p><p>AWS Healthcare Accelerator's first cohort will be done in <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/pediatrics-field-lags-digital-innovations-new-accelerator-looking-change-paradigm">partnership with KidsX</a>, a pediatric-focused digital health incubator that launched in September of 2020. However, the new AWS accelerator does not have a pediatric focus, and companies in the accelerator program can cater to any patient population.</p><p>"The program&nbsp;is&nbsp;tailored&nbsp;to&nbsp;accelerate&nbsp;growth&nbsp;in the cloud,&nbsp;with a focus on solutions like remote patient monitoring, voice technology, analytics, patient engagement&nbsp;and virtual care," Sandy Carter, VP of&nbsp;partners and programs for the&nbsp;worldwide public sector at&nbsp;AWS, wrote in a statement.</p>
