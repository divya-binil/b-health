<p>In one large-scale study, mean engagement with the app lasted only 4.1 days.<br><br>Studies using mobile health applications are hampered by significantly high participant dropout rates, although retention strategies can help maintain participant engagement, according to a <a href="https://jmir.org/2022/4/e35120#ref2">study</a> published in <i>JMIR</i>.</p><p>The adoption of mobile health (mHealth) apps has been increasing in the research sphere, and researchers have been able to monitor day-to-day fluctuations of a wide range of real-time data using these apps.</p><p>However, a fundamental challenge to many studies is the rapid and substantial participant dropout, the study explained.</p><p>The researchers focused on databases of mHealth studies in PubMed, MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases for mHealth studies from 2015 to 2020. In one large-scale mHealth study included in the report, the Stanford-led MyHeart Counts study, the engagement with the app was only 4.1 days.</p><p>"It is imperative for mHealth studies to minimize participant dropout, as substantial attrition may reduce study power and threaten the representativeness of the sample,"&nbsp;the report advised.</p>
