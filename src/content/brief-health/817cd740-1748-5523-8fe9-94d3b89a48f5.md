<p>6 digital health executive share their key takeaways and insights from attending this year's VIVE conference. The growing rivalry for health consumers was a recurring theme in my interactions at ViVE. Smaller specialties, like Northwell Health, which indicated their outpatient care volumes are continuing to climb, continue to divide larger health systems. Large healthcare systems are being watched by independent surgery centres, emergency rooms, urgent care centres, primary care offices, imaging facilities, and others in an effort to take advantage of them for the most lucrative parts of their operations. The health business is headed for further rapid upheaval as this plays out alongside the losses brought on by the pandemic. Strategic health executives will carefully examine how they are involving patients and ensure they have adopted the appropriate patient engagement strategies to avoid this syphoning off of business.</p>
