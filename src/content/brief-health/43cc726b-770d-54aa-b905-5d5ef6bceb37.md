<p>Leaders cited collaboration and resiliency as two major cybersecurity themes at the HIMSS21 conference in Las Vegas Aug. 9-13<br><br>HIMSS21 took place later in the year than usual, due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the Delta variant’s attempt to bring in-person events once again to a screeching halt, the conference, sponsored by the Chicago-based Healthcare Information &amp; Management Systems Society (HIMSS), took place at the Venetian-Sands Expo Center, Caesars Forum Conference Center, and Wynn in Las Vegas during Aug. 9-13. All attendees were required to be vaccinated and masks were required per Nevada’s statewide mandate at the time.</p>
