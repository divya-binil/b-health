<p>There is a shortage of primary care providers (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) in the U.S. In California, the shortage has been troublesome, especially in rural areas. The government recommends 60-80 primary care providers per 100,000 population; in California, the number is down to 50 in urban areas and even lower in rural areas. In addition, 2.5 million Californians who previously were uninsured, have gained insurance through the Affordable Care Act and are now eligible for coverage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
