<p>KLAS and CHIME <a href="https://chimecentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Trends-in-EMR-Interoperability_CHIME_KLAS.pdf">report</a> on the state of EMR interoperability in 2020 outlining 10 interoperability trends that highlight areas of progress and opportunities for industry improvement.</p><p>Compared to the previous KLAS’ report on interoperability published in 2017, the data for 2020 suggest substantial progress including improved access to external records and data exchange through APIs. Still, there is room for growth. The ‘Trends in EMR Interoperability’ report outlines 10 trends in the interoperability area that could inform the interoperability development in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Progress in deep iteroperability. </strong>In general, organisations that are achieving deep interoperability are still few, but their number has increased twofold since 2017. About two-thirds of providers report to often/nearly always have access to required records, and the records’ viewing and use has become much more user-friendly.</p><p><strong>Improved external connections.</strong> The report shows that nearly all EMR vendors now provide much more efficient connectivity to outside EMR records despite the regulatory challenges and lack of technical expertise in some cases. Vendors are now more focussed on API adoption and standardisation for better interoperability (e.g. FHIR adoption).</p><p><strong>Smaller institutions are more connected.</strong> This shift is driven, on the one hand, by increasing expectations with regard to EMR interoperability that push vendors to improve shared access to data, and, on the other hand, by the ongoing EMR vendor consolidation and, consequently, ability for users to connect to a wider network of one vendor.</p><p><strong>Use of apps is growing.</strong> While in general applications are yet to be widely adopted, many healthcare providers use patient-facing apps. There is a mix of both vendor and internal solutions, with the latter implying the need for FHIR-based certification.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
