<p>Amid "some of the worst" margins since the beginning of the pandemic, many hospitals and health systems around the United States have been forced to lay off workers, limit services, and even shut down, Dave Muoio writes for Fierce Healthcare.
While some hospital layoffs have been the result of facility closures, others have been coupled with a promise to help some employees transition to other roles within the health system.
According to the health system, the layoffs included directors, managers, and staffing coordinators, and they were encouraged to apply to one of 2,000 open positions within the organization.
Bozeman Health Deaconess in early August cut 28 leadership and leadership support staff positions and closed 25 job openings, citing pandemic-induced economic challenges.
Commonwealth Health announced that it will close its First Hospital psychiatric center and other outpatient locations at the end of October a move that will result in the termination of 245 employees.
According to a notice filed with New York, Garnet Health on Nov. 9 will close five outpatient sites, which will result in 29 layoffs.
In May, St. Charles Health System announced 105 layoffs and closed 76 job openings, with the health system's CEO citing expense increases, reduced surgery volumes, and relief paybacks that will lead the organization to "likely end 2022 in the red," adding that the reductions were necessary "to ensure the long-term financial stability of the health system." 
14 notice, St. Vincent Charity Medical Center announced its transition from an acute care hospital to an ambulatory health services centerâ€”a move that will eliminate 978 positions, effective Nov. 15.
In September, Yale New Haven Health laid off 72 junior and senior management employees and closed 83 job openings.</p>
