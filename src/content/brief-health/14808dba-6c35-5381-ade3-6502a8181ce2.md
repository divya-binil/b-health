<p>Smart algorithms will soon diagnose skin cancer, dermatologists consult patients online, and 3D printers will print out synthetic skin to fight tissue shortages.
Skin cancer is too common
Data from the US Skin Cancer Foundation suggests that each year over 5.4 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer are treated in more than 3.3 million people only in the US.
The annual cost of treating skin cancers there is estimated at $8.1 billion: about $4.8 billion for non-melanoma skin cancers and $3.3 billion for melanoma, which is an insanely huge number.
Luckily, digital technologies are on their way to help dermatologists diagnose and treat skin diseases better and more effectively.
As you can easily detect if you have a skin problem, and smartphones coupled with super-fast internet connection make it easy to send pictures or footage anywhere, telehealth solutions appeared naturally in dermatology.
FirstDerm, DermatologistOnCall, Direct Dermatology, Online Skin Specialist or iDoc24 and you can find many other providers.
Therefore, it comes as no surprise that Google decided to throw their hat in the ring: the tech giant launched an A.I.-based app to diagnose skin conditions.
Many skin cancer types and other skin problems are treated with laser therapies, and a study found that robots might be able to help there.</p>
