<p>After assessing the digital maturity of 49 hospitals in Poland at the request of the Polish Ministry of Health, HIMSS recommends the ministry focus on patient engagement, telehealth, workforce development, clinical decision support and closed loop administration processes. In 2022, the ministry invited HIMSS to reevaluate the implementation of digital technology in 49 institutions. Three key objectives were sought for by this assessment: &nbsp;</p><ul><li>Determine which IT solutions should be adopted to boost the technical capability of hospitals and increase the quality and accessibility of healthcare services. &nbsp;</li><li>Recognise the integration techniques for healthcare IT solutions. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Create new Health Information System features to completely integrate the following three e-services: &nbsp;</li><li>electronic medical records are traded &nbsp;</li><li>E-registration for appointments made online &nbsp;</li><li>internet transactions between hospitals &nbsp; &nbsp;</li></ul><p>"HIMSS is once again delighted to be working on behalf of the Polish Ministry of Health in assessing 49 hospitals using the international standards contained with the Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model," stated John Rayner, Digital Health.</p>
