<p>The companies say the platform will allow patients at New York's largest healthcare provider to access a broad spectrum of clinical services.<br><br><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>At a time when the future of telehealth remains uncertain, Northwell – which serves more than 2 million people annually in the New York metro area – is signaling its commitment to bolstering its virtual care services for patients.</p><p>The companies say that the Teladoc platform will allow patients to access a broad spectrum of clinical services through a unified experience. The implementation, which will start at 20 of Northwell's 22 hospitals and expand over time to more affiliates,&nbsp;aims to facilitate direct-to-patient scheduled visits for clinicians.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Teladoc's collaboration with Microsoft Teams, <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/teladoc-and-microsoft-team-integrated-virtual-care">announced this past July</a>, offered integrated clinical and administrative medical office operations. This, said the organizations, could allow a more seamless workflow for providers. &nbsp;</p>
