<p>WATERTOWN, Mass &amp; ROCKVILLE, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--athenahealth, a leading provider of network-enabled software and services for medical groups and healthcare organizations nationwide, and health technology pioneer, DrFirst, today announced they are partnering to help improve medication adherence and patient outcomes.
athenahealth’s large user base will now be able to send patient medication notifications powered by DrFirst’s RxInform to reduce prescription abandonment and help patients adhere to their recommended medication therapies. Now, the athenahealth electronic health record (EHR) system that helps providers maximize clinical productivity and focus on delivering high-quality care to patients connects with RxInform, which automatically triggers a secure message to a patient’s mobile device when a clinician sends a prescription order to a pharmacy.
“Primary care providers and specialists who care for high-risk patients need tools to help people take their medications as prescribed,” said G.
“We’re pleased to partner with athenahealth to give its network of approximately 145,000 providers access to the RxInform platform so they can help patients overcome the common hurdles that lead them to abandon their medications at the pharmacy.”
Since 2000, DrFirst has pioneered healthcare technology solutions and consulting services that securely connect people at touchpoints of care to improve patient outcomes.</p>
