<p>The financial IT used by University Physicians’ Association increased patient payments by 43%, and the payment lag for self-pay patients is down 20 days. “That’s huge,” a UPA exec says.<br><br>University Physicians’ Association manages the medical billing services for more than 475 physicians in Knoxville, Tennessee, and serves as an advisor to medical practices across the eastern part of the state.</p><p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong></p><p>As a growing business, it needed to take a look at optimizing the efficiency of its central billing office and how patients paid their bills. Not only is UPA growing, but patients continue to absorb a higher percentage of the cost of their medical care.</p><p>“Collecting from patients is quite different than collecting from insurance companies and Medicare/Medicaid,” said Christy Bailey, vice president of client strategy and revenue operations at UPA. “We needed the ability to get notification of debt to the consumer quickly. When competing with other sources, we wanted to ensure we were doing all we could to collect first. We were behind industry standards and wanted to take the lead, not fall behind.”</p><p>Many of the patients UPA serves see multiple physicians that use UPA, creating multiple accounts per patient. The process for applying patient payments across more than one balance required staff to open each patient account separately and manually post a portion of the payment to each balance.</p>
