<p>At HIMSS23, Holly Maloney, managing director of General Catalyst, discussed the promise and challenge of using artificial intelligence in healthcare. Holly Maloney, managing director of General Catalyst, spoke on Wednesday during Venture Connect at HIMSS23 on ethical AI use in healthcare and what the company looks for in a startup when considering an investment. "Over the last three to four years, we've put pen to paper of truly defining what is our thesis," Maloney added. And everything revolves on the idea of health assurances. How can we transform a historically poorly integrated, extremely expensive, and more reactive system into one that is genuinely focused on accessibility, quality, lower costs, and personalised proactive experiences? Responsible innovation, according to Maloney, is essential to provide healthcare services that are data-driven and consumer-focused. Technology has the potential to bring about enormous change, but it also comes with a lot of responsibility.</p>
