<p>Imagine a technology that enables you to continuously do human-like processes and jobs without the need for rest, sometimes even bettering them. One of the key causes of artificial intelligence's (AI) meteoric rise in popularity is because of this. John McCarthy, who is frequently credited as the originator of artificial intelligence, offered a definition, saying, "It is the science and engineering of building intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programmes. Although it is related to the related job of utilising computers to comprehend human intellect, AI should not be limited to techniques that can be observed by biological means.By the year 2023, it's anticipated that AI would be one of the most commonly used technologies across industries globally, being included into many routine tasks.</p>
