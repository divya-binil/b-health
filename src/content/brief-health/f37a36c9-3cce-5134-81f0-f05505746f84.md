<p>A J.D. Power study indicates telehealth is the preferred method among consumers for receiving certain types of medical care.
The J.D. Power 2022 U.S. Telehealth Satisfaction Study released today shows a stark increase in consumers preferring telehealth visits over in-person appointments for a broad range of routine care.
Telehealth has the potential to increase access, convenience, care coordination and continuity, improve outcomes and fill in gaps in provider coverage, particularly in underserved areas.</p>
