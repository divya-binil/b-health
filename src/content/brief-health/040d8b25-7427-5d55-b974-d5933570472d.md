<p>Pharmaceutical firm Bayer has partnered with digital health company DoctorOnCall and the Endometriosis Association of Malaysia (MyEndosis) to launch a telehealth platform dedicated to endometriosis. "Given that more women in Asia comparatively are affected by this condition, we see great significance in working with Bayer to launch this first-ever dedicated endometriosis platform in Malaysia," said DoctorOnCall COO Chiak Tang. Other new functionalities of the app include the option to edit profile; link and unlink ABHA numbers from the health ID address; and login via face and other biometric authentication. The agreement adds PERDIM doctors to the network of healthcare providers on DoctorOnCall. Hong Kong-listed health tech firm IntelliCentrics has signed a memorandum of understanding with insurance company Taiwan Life Insurance Co. to provide online health services to Taiwanese people going abroad. The partnership will provide Watsons' customers with access to online health consultations with doctors from DOC2US via the Watsons Malaysia mobile app.</p>
