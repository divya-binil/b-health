<p>Four medtech executives talked about&nbsp;the future of hospital at home, and the difference between consumer devices and medical devices, in an event hosted by the Colorado Bioscience Association. The Golden, Colorado-based startup BioIntelliSense makes a wearable sticker that records temperature, breathing rate, and heart rate, among other variables. Last summer, Medtronic's patient monitoring division partnered with BioIntelliSense. The organisation identified a trend where more patients were moving from high-acuity regions of the hospital to lower-acuity settings and their homes, which was one of the factors that led to the purchase. In a panel discussion last week, Frank Chan, president of Medtronic's patient monitoring business, said that the company provides its customers with the technology that enables clinicians to follow patients into lower-acuity hospital areas where monitoring is "sometimes not well done or not done at all, and then follow them to the home."</p>
