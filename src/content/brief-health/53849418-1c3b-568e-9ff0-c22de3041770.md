<p>Leveraging their combined data and research expertise will enable reduced research timelines, clinical care pathway development and testing, and early disease intervention, partners say. Northeast Ohio's University Hospitals (UH) and Premier Inc.'s PINC AI Applied Sciences (PAS) are working together to promote clinical research, provide real-world evidence, and investigate the creation of new approaches, therapies, and other cutting-edge healthcare initiatives. The research collaboration will make use of standardised and interconnected data, such as the PINC AI Healthcare Database, which has information on more than 1 billion unique inpatient and outpatient contacts from more than 1,000 geographically dispersed facilities. According to the organisations, these data assets will aid in the launching of prospective research and clinical trial opportunities that are supported by thorough insights and cover the entire patient path. The clinical areas that UH and PAS intend to concentrate on include value-based initiatives linked to equality and disparities, quality and value enhancement in primary and specialty care.</p>
