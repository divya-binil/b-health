Feel plans to further strengthen its software by using the power of customer data to better tailor and suggest more relevant health products to its customer base.</p><p>Boris Hodakel, Founder and CEO of Feel said, "I'm thrilled to be welcoming to Feel our new investors who understand our mission in empowering people to look and feel their best, through clean, high-performing, science-led, sustainable products.

We are thrilled to become part of Feel's journey and cannot wait to see how Feel will become a household must-have item across the UK and beyond."</p><p>Sheena Amin, Director of ITV AdVentures said, "I continue to be impressed by the stellar growth that Feel has achieved over the past years, which ITV AdVentures has been able to supercharge through the power of TV advertising. I am excited to continue to support them through this next expansion phase, as they look to strengthen their position in existing markets and bring their quality products and strong brand to new international territories.
