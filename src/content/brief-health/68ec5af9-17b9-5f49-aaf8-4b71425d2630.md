<p>Partnering with community clinics and health centers to bring MRI closer to the patients who need it most, in both rural and urban areas
Siemens Healthineers is committed to developing MR systems that not only expand MRI's capabilities and efficiency, but also lower the barrier for healthcare providers and communities that previously lacked the means to own and operate an MRI.
Q. You suggest access to MRI can be increased by hospitals and health systems partnering with community clinics and health centers to bring MRI closer to the patients who need it most, in both rural and urban areas.
In MRI's case, providing outpatient diagnostic imaging services in the community creates a valuable convenience for patients by reducing the time needed in their schedule and simplifying the overall process.
Q. You also say access to MRI can be increased by designing machines that are more affordable for the smaller community hospitals or health centers that provide care in underserved areas.
Q. And you further suggest access to MRI can be increased by health IT vendors pioneering technology innovations to increase access, such as MRIs with decreased field strength – while maintaining image quality – which are more accessible.</p>
