Healthcare is a good industry for women to work in, but barriers remain for those seeking to reach the C-suite—especially for women of color, according to a new study. Healthcare is a good industry for women to work in, but barriers remain for those seeking to reach the C-suite—especially for women of color, according to a new study. 

Researchers at McKinsey & Company examined pipeline data from 33 healthcare companies, surveyed nearly 11,000 employees at 11 companies and interviewed 10 senior executives to compile a report on how female workers are faring in the healthcare industry. 

They found that women are better represented at all levels in healthcare than in corporate America overall. For example, women make up 63% of the entry-level workforce and 30% of the C-suite in healthcare, compared to 48% and 22%, respectively, across all industries.
