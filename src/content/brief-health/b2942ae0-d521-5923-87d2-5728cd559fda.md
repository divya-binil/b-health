<p>We explore the role of ambient clinical intelligence in improving patient care and reducing clinician burnout through a discussion with pediatric orthopedic surgeon Dr. Alfred Atanda Jr. With market leadership in conversational AI and ambient clinical intelligence products like Dragon Medical One and Dragon Ambient eXperience that enhance people's ability to aid others, Nuance Communications, Inc., now a part of Microsoft, is a technology innovator. Frontline health care professionals have long struggled with burnout. Many doctors are expressing experiences of burnout because to the COVID pandemic, which has increased burnout's severity and scope. Pre-pandemic burnout was reported by 42% of doctors; post-pandemic burnout was reported by 64% of doctors. Regrettably, the issue is likely to endure due to an ageing population (83.7M individuals 65 or older by 2050) and an increasing physician shortage (90K predicted by 2025). Burnout has had a detrimental effect. Clinical intelligence is a type of artificial intelligence that helps healthcare providers make better decisions by analyzing large amounts of data. To reduce physician burnout, clinical intelligence can be used in the following ways:</p><ul><li>Reduce administrative tasks: Clinical intelligence can help automate administrative tasks such as documentation and billing, which can free up physicians' time and reduce their workload.</li><li>Streamline workflows: Clinical intelligence can be used to identify inefficiencies in workflows and suggest improvements to streamline processes. This can help reduce the amount of time physicians spend on non-clinical tasks.</li><li>Improve clinical decision-making: Clinical intelligence can help physicians make more informed clinical decisions by analyzing patient data, providing real-time alerts and reminders, and offering evidence-based recommendations.</li><li>Identify patients at risk: Clinical intelligence can be used to identify patients at risk of adverse events or hospital readmissions, allowing physicians to intervene early and provide more targeted care.</li><li>Enhance patient engagement: Clinical intelligence can help improve patient engagement by providing personalized recommendations, education, and support. This can lead to better health outcomes and increased patient satisfaction.</li></ul><p>By leveraging clinical intelligence in these ways, healthcare organizations can help reduce physician burnout by reducing administrative burden, improving workflows, enhancing clinical decision-making, identifying patients at risk, and enhancing patient engagement.</p>
