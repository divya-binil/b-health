<p>We are living through an AI revolution. New, amazing tools become available almost every day, and they have attracted the attention of the general public. Algorithms like ChatGPT and Midjourney provide value to pretty much everyone, and the field became the playground of laypeople too, it’s not just for computer scientists anymore.</p><p>So, you are a doctor and want to build a medical practice. What AI tools are of your assistance? Here is a list of solutions anyone can use – and this time we focused on algorithms not strictly connected to medicine.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NOTE: LEGAL ISSUES MIGHT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED</strong></p><p>This is a list of general ideas, aimed to give an overview of the possibilities. By no means would I declare that all legal issues are sufficiently settled regarding using these in patient-doctor interactions. Before you decide to implement such tools in your practice, make sure you fully understand all privacy and data handling implications.</p><p>Without further ado, here is what a doctor can do with AI today – outside the strict boundaries of diagnosis and treatments.</p>
