<p>When Truepill first launched, it described itself as the AWS for pharmacies, powering companies like Hims, Nurx, LemonAID and other direct-to-consumer healthcare brands.
The disruption in service impacted employees within Truepill’s recently acquired adult ADHD treatment company, Ahead. Just weeks prior to Truepill’s layoffs, the company announced the hire of Paul Greenall as chief business officer, the first person to take on that position since launch.
Meanwhile, resources remain in flux for impacted Truepill employees.
A Slack group of former Truepill employees shows that those impacted by prior layoffs are struggling to get clarity on severance payments and land access to healthcare coverage.</p>
