<p>Healthy.io secures $50M to expand the company’s clinical-grade kidney test and patient engagement service for health plans. With the participation of Aleph and other current shareholders, Schusterman Family Investments leads a $50 million Series D fundraising round for Healthy.io, the world leader in turning smartphone cameras into clinical-grade devices. The company's Series D consists of this investment and a $45 million undisclosed investment made in February 2022. The Series D investment will help Healthy.io expand across the U.S. market, where top health plans, health systems, and renal care management organisations have expanded their demand for Minuteful KidneyTM, the company's clinical-grade kidney test and patient engagement service. More Americans are at risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) but go undiagnosed and untreated as rates of diabetes and hypertension rise nationwide. The major cause is CKD.</p>
