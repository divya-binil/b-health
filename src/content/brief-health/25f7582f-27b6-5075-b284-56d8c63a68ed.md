<p>Will artificial intelligence (AI) and/or digital health increase health equity? This is one of the inquiries I receive most frequently. The solution isn't as simple as a yes or no, despite the question's seeming simplicity. Given that this study will be lengthy, the TLDR version is as follows: Yes, it is possible that AI and digital health will eventually increase health equity. But it will take time, and during this period of adjustment, the disparity might potentially momentarily expand. It's crucial to remember that achieving health equity through digital health is not a technology issue. Does the introduction of technologies into healthcare as part of this cultural revolution increase or decrease people's access to healthcare? That is the crucial question we must ultimately answer.</p>
