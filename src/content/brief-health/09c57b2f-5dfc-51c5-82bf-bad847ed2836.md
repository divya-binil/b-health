<p>Recent data shows that patients admitted to short-term acute care hospitals (STACHs) have increasingly complicated medical conditions. This has led many hospitals to seek support from experienced management partners in the long-term acute care hospital (LTACH) space to help address the unique needs of this critical population. While medically complex and critically ill patients make up only 5% of the U.S. patient population, they account for 50% of healthcare spending.1</p><p>Lack of access for high-acuity patients in the post-acute care setting often leads to discharge delays from STACHs. These delays can be detrimental for the patient and payors. Treatment at an LTACH is often the most appropriate care setting for reducing avoidable delays in discharge and recovery.</p><p><strong>Read this guide to discover four benefits LTACHs have on the sickest and most vulnerable patient population. You will also learn how adding LTACH services to your health systemâ€™s care continuum or working with a management partner to optimize your current service can help reduce avoidable days, lower total cost of care and improve outcomes for the system overall.</strong></p>
