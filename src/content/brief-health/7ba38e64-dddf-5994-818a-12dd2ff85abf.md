<p>Healthcare lawyer Andrew Selesnick said one key will be to establish a stable, user-friendly platform that can make documentation seamless.<br><br>The future potential of telehealth hinges on how it's reimbursed. Virtual care may be popular among patients, but if providers can't get paid for their services, it's unlikely they'll be able to continue to provide them.</p><p>The government has signaled its support for reimbursing some telehealth services, at least in the short term. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services <a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/cms-will-reimburse-11-new-telehealth-services-during-public-health-emergency">announced earlier this month</a>, for example, that it would add 11 virtual services to its reimbursement list during the COVID-19 public health emergency â€“ following in the footsteps of its earlier <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-19-physicians-and-practitioners.pdf.">flexibilities for virtual care</a>.</p><p>This could act as a signal for other payers to do the same, said Andrew Selesnick, a shareholder in Buchalter's Los Angeles office, in a <i>Healthcare IT News</i> interview. "The government can play a very positive role in telehealth by establishing clear standards and clear reimbursement guidelines," said Selesnick. If the government, for example, requires documentation for certain services and certain rules around telehealth, "then the payers will be hard pressed to ignore them for a lengthy period of time."&nbsp;</p>
