<p>Let's look at the top digital technologies from virtual reality through A.I. to CRISPR that will revolutionise dentistry in the future.<br><br>No one likes to go to the dentist in spite of the fact that everyone knows how crucial oral health is and how strongly it is connected to our overall health.
But an armada of new technologies from virtual reality through artificial intelligence (A.I.) to CRISPR will revolutionise dentistry and our whole attitude towards oral health in the future.
Such smart algorithms can be integrated within the healthcare system to analyse health data, research findings and treatment techniques to offer diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for individual patients.</p>
