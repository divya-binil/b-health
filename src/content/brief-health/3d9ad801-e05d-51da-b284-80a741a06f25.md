<p>We’ve spent a good part of our summer writing about Big Tech and how these companies, <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/amazons-march-into-healthcare-a-2021-update">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/googles-masterplan-for-healthcare">Google/Alphabet</a>, <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/microsoft-in-healthcare-2021">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/apple-in-healthcare-2021">Apple</a>, <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/ibm-in-healthcare-2021">IBM</a> and <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/nvidia-in-healthcare-2021">NVIDIA</a> have approached medicine and its trillion-dollar market possibilities. These six companies have the most projects in healthcare, and their presence is not negligible at all: they all have the power and the incentive to transform and help digitise this market.</p><p>Moreover, all of these companies have something peculiar and very unique to give. Amazon’s distribution network can change the way we think of pharmacies in the future. Microsoft can bring steadiness, reason and predictability. Apple’s design and seamless approach make us see systems as flawless organisms. Google’s in-depth knowledge of A.I. and its practical use in cure. IBM bringing its power and history onto the field of machine learning and quantum computing. And last but not least, a relative newcomer, NVIDIA knowing how to manufacture systems and practical implementations.<br>&nbsp;</p>
