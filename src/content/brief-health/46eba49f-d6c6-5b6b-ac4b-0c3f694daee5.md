<p>CVS on Thursday announced the launch of its new CVS Health Virtual Primary Care service.</p><p><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong><br>The new offering integrates patient engagement tools, telehealth, electronic health record data and more on a single platform that can connect consumers with clinicians at CVS or other providers.</p><p>The tool enables patients to choose care in either retail or community-based settings, through at-home health services&nbsp;or virtually, according to CVS Health, which is selling the service to Aetna fully insured, self-insured plan sponsors, and CVS Caremark clients.</p><p>Designed as a complement to Aetna's virtual care strategy, the platform will be available for eligible Aetna members beginning January 1, 2023, officials say, and for eligible CVS Caremark members in Q2 of next year.</p><p>CVS Health says the offering will provide access to on-demand primary care, chronic condition management, virtual mental health services and more – with the option of being seen in-person at in-network providers, including MinuteClinic, when needed. Telehealth-based providers can help members find appropriate in-network specialists and other services, too.</p><p>CVS Health Virtual Primary Care will feature a member-selected physician-led Care Team – comprising, for example, nurse practitioners, RNs or licensed vocational nurses – who can be accessed through the platform. They can consult with CVS pharmacists for medication management needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
