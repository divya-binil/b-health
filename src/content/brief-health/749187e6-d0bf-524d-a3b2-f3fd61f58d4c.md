<p>This is where digital platforms are making personalized medicine a reality by bringing technology and human services together for daily analysis and monitoring of data.
Technology, however, comes to the rescue, as doctors and care providers can now understand the variations in blood sugar responses to various foods, fitness profiles, food habits and work-out attitudes and develop a personalized treatment plan. On the other hand, smart diagnostics can ensure daily monitoring and analysis of data which helps the patient adhere to the treatment plan, thereby improving the outcomes significantly. Some areas where digital therapeutics is already finding application is diabetes reversal, weight loss, PCOS management, improving quality of dialysis for kidney disease patients and home monitoring of dialysis, bettering cardiac health, improving mental health outcomes and stress management, stepping up respiratory care, monitoring stroke treatment and rehabilitation, etc.
Risk screening can be done at the community level and data sent to the doctor at the primary health care centre who can then prescribe medicines and give advice.
Digital therapeutics programmes can lead to better health outcomes at organizational levels as well.</p>
