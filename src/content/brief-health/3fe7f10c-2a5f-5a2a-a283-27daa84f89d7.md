<p>The engine that propels healthcare to comprehend disease is pathology. The field might be pushed to become more scalable and efficient by digital technologies. They might make pathologists' work more innovative and data-driven while facilitating quicker and more precise diagnosis for patients. Let's take a look at what pathology will look like in the future. For more than 150 years, pathology, the basis of medicine, has hardly changed. At the NVIDIA GPU Technology Conference, Thomas Fuchs, Director of Computational Pathology Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Founder of Paige.AI, who is developing machine learning algorithms to help digitise pathology, stated that despite the fact that the pathologist's diagnosis is the foundation of medicine, the field has not undergone any significant change in the last 150 years.</p>
