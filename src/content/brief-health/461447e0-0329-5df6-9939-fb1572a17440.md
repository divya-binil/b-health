<p>Actions by state and federal officials have loosened many of those barriers, allowing providers to test new platforms and see more reimbursement. Kimball says her providers have long clashed with payers over coverage, and sheâ€™s hoping the success they see now will convince payers to maintain these new guidelines after the pandemic has eased.</p><p>That helped the health system expand from its fast-growing ExpressCare Virtual telehealth platform to stable services that now include remote patient monitoring for roughly 300 patients in the Seattle area. That program will soon be expanded throughout the enterprise to help other hospitals manage their populations at home.</p><p><br><a href="https://mhealthintelligence.com/news/cms-launches-new-medicare-payment-model-for-911-triage-by-telehealth">Read on mhealthintelligence.com</a></p>
