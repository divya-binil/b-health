<p>FDB Navigo provides retail pharmacists with targeted, consolidated and actionable clinical guidance at the most optimal time in their workflow. Specifically, FDB Navigo provides actionable guidance to the pharmacist based on the most important risks to the patient as reflected in the patient's clinical record in the pharmacy's system.
FDB Navigo assists the retail pharmacist to determine the "next best step" for each patient, whether that is to fill the prescription, provide additional guidance to the patient, or follow up with the patient's physician.
Ultimately, FDB Navigo gives retail pharmacists more time and cognitive space to consult with patients and offer more primary care services.
"FDB is pleased to offer a transformative clinical guidance solution that helps pharmacists meet these demands and practice at the top of their license in order to best serve the health and safety needs of their patients."
FDB Navigo can help retail pharmacists free up time to perform these important services.
Chirag Patel, PharmD, senior product manager for FDB said: "FDB Navigo leverages additional patient information such as prescription history, previous alert outcomes, and universal medication schedule, &nbsp;to provide patient-specific context for clinical guidance, helping to ensure medication safety.</p>
