<p>PROVO, Utah &amp; SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Qualtrics (Nasdaq: XM), the leader and creator of the experience management category, today launched EX25 for Healthcare, a new methodology that provides hospitals and clinics with key questions to ask their employees so they can understand what matters most to their people and take action on what they hear.
During this time when healthcare organizations are dealing with staffing crises, exhaustion and turnover among nurses and physicians, the ability to deliver better employee experiences with empathy, speed and scale - has never been more critical.
By identifying the key drivers of employee experience and understanding how they differ between nurses and physicians, healthcare leaders can take meaningful, timely and empathetic actions on the things that matter most.
EX25 for Healthcare provides a modern framework that enables organizations to keep a pulse on six key outcomes of employee experience: intent to stay; engagement; experience vs.
</p><p>By asking the right questions at key moments, organizations can understand what influences the employee experience, and how those signals vary between nurses and physicians, in order to take informed and targeted actions that create a caring workplace for all.
In a recent panel study of nearly 5,000 nurses and physicians,1 Qualtrics found that growth and development and strategic alignment are two of the top five drivers behind both nurses’ and doctors’ intent to stay with their organization.
By identifying the top dimensions affecting employee experience, EX25 helps healthcare organizations go beyond engagement to amplify empathy by prioritizing the most important focus areas to improve retention.
Our EX25 methodology empowers healthcare organizations to understand the key drivers of employee experience across roles and departments, and then act with empathy, speed and scale.”
Qualtrics XM for Healthcare helps hospitals, health providers, retail, payer and life sciences organizations design experiences and products that create joy, build loyalty and earn trust.
Qualtrics, the leader and creator of the experience management category, is changing the way organizations manage and improve the four core experiences of business-customer, employee, product and brand.
Over 16,750 organizations around the world use Qualtrics to listen, understand and take action on experience data (X-data™) the beliefs, emotions and intentions that tell you why things are happening, and what to do about it.</p>
