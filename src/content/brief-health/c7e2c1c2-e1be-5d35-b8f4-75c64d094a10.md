<p>Digital health tools focused on improving patient engagement are starting to have an impact on surgery outcomes. In a recent interview, John Monson, M.D., executive director of colorectal surgery at AdventHealth in Orlando, Fla., described the role of a tool called Twistle in his department’s deployment of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols that begin 30 days prior to surgery and continue 30 days post-discharge.</p><p>Although significant innovations have led to advancements in colorectal surgery, the procedures remain high-risk for complications after surgery. As part of a comprehensive approach to improving outcomes, AdventHealth Orlando deployed Twistle in 2018 to improve pre-operative and post-operative patient engagement. The Twistle pathway for colorectal procedures includes education, preparation, appointment reminders, incision checks, side-effect monitoring, and bi-directional texting with patients.</p><p>The ERAS protocols have been around for approximately 25 years, Monson said. They include 15 components that are aimed at restoring people's physiology after surgery in a speedier fashion and getting them out of the hospital sooner. “If you consider a patient has an operation on day one, and might be considered to be more or less recovered 14 days later, what enhanced recovery does is bring a patient to the same level in seven days rather than 14 days,” Monson explained.</p>
