<p>The U.S. is facing a shortage of physicians, with estimates of a deficit of 54,000 to 139,000 doctors by 2033, due to aging of the current workforce, increased competition for imports, and dissatisfaction with the health care workplace. As AI systems like ChatGPT are becoming more advanced and capable of performing tasks traditionally done by doctors, they may soon play a significant role in health care delivery. In addition to noting that over half of all currently practising physicians are over 55, a 2021 Merritt Hawkins article reports growing physician shortages in the U.S. The percentage of doctors who are "more than 55" ranges from 60 to 90+% in several medical disciplines. An updated article from Becker's Hospital Review published in January 2023 verified findings of a similar nature. According to these recent predictions, there will be a shortage of 54,000 to 139,000 physicians in the United States by 2033. The fact that the United States does not now train enough doctors to fulfil even the current demand, much less the impending bulge as the 76 million baby boomers continue to have rising medical needs, only serves to exacerbate the issue.</p>
