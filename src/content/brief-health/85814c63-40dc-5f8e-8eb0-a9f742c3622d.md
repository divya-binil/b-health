<p>Adrian Zai, MD, offers advice to health systems looking to position themselves for success in the world of accountable care.<br><br>SAN FRANCISCO – Boston-based Partners HealthCare has long been one the more innovative and forward-thinking health systems in the U.S. But many hospitals don't embrace the same culture of innovation, said Adrian Zai, MD, director of research at Partners eCare, speaking at the HIMSS Big Data and Healthcare Analytics Forum on Wednesday.</p><p>Yes, most healthcare providers understand that data and analytics are essential for quality improvement and operational efficiencies. And most realize that the shift to value-based reimbursement means they should probably rethink some of their care delivery processes and IT infrastructure, said Zai.</p><p>But too many are still either unwilling or unable to approach innovation with the gusto and strategy that could help them drive big improvements in their patient experience and bottom line.</p><p>"Innovation improves competitiveness, ROI and culture," said Zai. "It is critical to innovate now more than ever as we shift to value-based care."</p>
