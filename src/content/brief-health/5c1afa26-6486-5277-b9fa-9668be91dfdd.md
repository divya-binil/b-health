<p>Surveys show that while patients are satisfied on several levels, safety issues remain a significant concern, especially when children are being treated.<br><br>A new survey by The Leapfrog Group of patients at hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers suggests that while they are satisfied on several levels, safety issues <a href="http://www.leapfroggroup.org/patient-experience-report">remain a significant concern</a>, especially when children are being treated.</p><ul><li>Leapfrog's Patient Experience Report — which analyzes responses to three different Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys that were conducted in 2019 — also raises concerns that patients may not be aware of the need for a continuum of care after they are discharged from the hospital.</li><li>Outpatient care, particularly ambulatory surgical centers — which are focused on relatively quick procedures and sending patients home the same day — received higher satisfaction scores than hospitals.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul>
