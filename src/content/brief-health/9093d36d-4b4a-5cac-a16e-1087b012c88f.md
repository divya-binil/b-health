<p>By offering access to images of varying disease presentations on real patients, VisualDx and ACEP are helping to further educate and prepare emergency physicians to test, diagnose, and treat the emergent disease. The Monkeypox Emergency Medicine Project provides a medically backed, up-to-date resource for physicians to study the virus, stay informed on new symptoms and cases, and make timely and evidence-based clinical decisions to improve outcomes across patient populations. Images in the Monkeypox Emergency Medicine Project will be accessible to ACEP members as well as other users of the VisualDx platform. For ACEP members and emergency physicians interested in joining the Monkeypox Emergency Medicine Project effort and contributing medical photos.</p>
