<p>We strongly believe that only digital health can bring healthcare into the 21st century and make patients the point-of-care.<br><br>Yes, it’s THAT time of the year and it’s always good to look back at the year – <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/2020-jumanji-or-dystopia">even to this one</a>. For it’s easy to say 2020 was disastrous, but there were many aspects that bring hope for the future (we dedicated an <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/why-theres-hope-in-2021">entire article to these here</a>). We also hope that you personally could also find highlights and elevating moments in your life in 2020.</p><p>Besides personal developments The Medical Futurist community <a href="https://www.facebook.com/medicalfuturist/photos/a.663812467046725/3173460709415209">realised</a>, COVID-19 has provided us with massive challenges on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/medicalfuturist/photos/a.663812467046725/2750861311675153">team level </a>as well. Our way of working has changed, my speeches were <a href="https://www.facebook.com/medicalfuturist/photos/a.663812467046725/2751280828299868">cancelled</a>, we were quarantined – but we <a href="https://www.facebook.com/medicalfuturist/photos/a.663812467046725/3324348544326424">came out strong</a>. So did digital health solutions, from a massive rise <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/5-things-we-learnt-about-investments-in-digital-health-new-e-book">in investments</a> and <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/the-rise-of-at-home-lab-tests">at-home lab tests</a> to <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/covid-19-was-needed-for-telemedicine-to-finally-go-mainstream">telemedicine</a> platforms.</p><p>I hope you have become stronger as well. For if 2020 was good for something, is that it provided us with a perspective on what is and what isn’t important in our lives. We were challenged and we had nowhere to go – we had no one, but ourselves and our closest relatives. We learned how to support each other in hard times, and we had to learn how to cope with mental and physical challenges alike. Hopefully you who are reading this now, came out stronger yourself.</p>
