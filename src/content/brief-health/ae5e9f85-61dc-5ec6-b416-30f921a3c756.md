<p>Heart-health-focused startup Eko is launching a new version of its Eko app, which uses an AI algorithm to help detect heart disease.
The new app can be paired with one of Eko's smart stethoscopes and is equipped with an AI software algorithm, which was FDA-cleared in 2020.
According to Eko, its AI algorithm for heart-murmur detection has a 87.5% sensitivity and 87.8% specificity.
In 2020, Eko scored FDA 510(k) clearance for its atrial-fibrillation- and heart-murmur-detection algorithm.</p>
