Nurses can access relevant information at their fingertips, enabling faster and more accurate health issue identification. To improve the experience of providing care for nurses and residents, Caspar, a pioneer in non-intrusive in-home sensing technology, has integrated ChatGPT. Nurses can easily acquire pertinent information thanks to ChatGPT&#39;s processing of data from the Internet. However, a recent study by Alkaissi and McFarlane revealed that ChatGPT&#39;s output could be incorrectly perceived or irrelevant without the necessary context. Caspar steps in at this point. According to Corey Gates, VP of Engineering at Caspar, &quot;Caspar&#39;s generative AI has access to 24/7 in-home data with which it creates a model for minute-by-minute behavioural predictions about residents, summarised in the form of warnings and observations for nurses and carers.&quot; Relevant context is provided when integrated with ChatGPT&#39;s input layer, enabling quicker and more precise issue identification.
