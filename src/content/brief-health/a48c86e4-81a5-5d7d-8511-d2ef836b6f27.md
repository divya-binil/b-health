<p>It's become common knowledge, at this point, that the flexibilities enabled by the federal government at the start of the COVID-19 public health emergency prompted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/study-365m-people-reveals-huge-jump-pandemic-telehealth-use">an atmospheric jump in telehealth use</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, the question has continued to loom: What will the future of those flexibilities – and, by extension, telehealth – look like?</p><p>"Last year, electronic health services played a critical role in keeping vulnerable Americans, particularly our seniors, safe from exposure while continuing to provide the care they need," said Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., in his opening remarks for a panel at the American Telemedicine Association's annual conference and expo this month.</p><p>"Our goal is to ensure these services remain accessible after the COVID-19 pandemic," continued Scott, who <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/connect-health-act-reintroduced-would-expand-telehealth-access">has cosponsored</a> two <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/bipartisan-bills-gain-support-telehealth-reform-sdoh-coordination">major telehealth bills</a> in Congress. &nbsp;</p><p>"As our country recovers, we have a responsibility to make sure our telehealth efforts move forward, not backward," he added.</p>
