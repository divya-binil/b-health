<p>Three years later, and COVID-19 needs no introduction. The virus has ravaged the United States this past year. But while COVID-19 has been unpredictable, the one thing we can count on this year is something we’d rather not: The annual flu season.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html#:~:text=CDC%20estimates%20that%20the%20burden,from%20influenza%20(Table%201).">CDC</a> estimated that during the 2018-2019 flu season, 35.5 million people fell ill with the flu, 16.5 million went to a healthcare provider, 490,600 were hospitalized, and 34,200 died. The CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/index.html">flu season preparation page</a> states, “Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing the spread of respiratory illnesses like the flu this fall and winter is more important than ever.”</p><p>We don’t yet know the impact the flu will have on the world this year. As <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coronavirus-and-the-flu-a-looming-double-threat/"><i>Scientific American</i></a> noted earlier this year, flu season could increase or even double the burden on healthcare facilities during COVID-19. Or, Americans’ healthy handwashing and social distancing habits could actually lessen the burden. Regardless, healthcare facilities must be prepared for the worst-case scenario. Here’s how your facility should prepare this flu season.</p>
