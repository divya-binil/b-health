<p>Let’s take a look of what we can expect from AI in healthcare in the coming period, focusing on providing specific examples instead of abstract principles. For our knowledgeable readership, we produce a tonne of in-depth articles on specialised subjects. It's also crucial to occasionally zoom out and just observe the overall scene. Here, we made the decision to give a high-level overview of what's to come for AI in healthcare in the hopes that it will be helpful. So let's take a high-level look at what the future of AI in healthcare holds. We won't go through general principles in this piece; instead, we'll concentrate on giving concrete examples. We seek to present a comprehensive picture of the possible contribution of AI to the transformation of healthcare by analysing existing developments and investigating potential future developments. Only locked algorithms have so far received approval.</p>
