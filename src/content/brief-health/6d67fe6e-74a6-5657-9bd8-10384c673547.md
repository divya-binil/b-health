<p>Manipal Hospitals in India has adopted a remote patient monitoring system by UK-based Isansys Lifecare. The system, which has been approved for use in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe, can be adopted in many health facilities and allows providers to quickly establish virtual wards while seamlessly incorporating patient data into their EMR.
Manipal Hospitals will use the Isansys PSE devices to continuously track the conditions of critical patients out of the ICU.</p>
