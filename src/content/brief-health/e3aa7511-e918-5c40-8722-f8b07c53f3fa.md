<p>Chief information officers and other health IT leaders depend on the data from their deployed record systems, and most keep EHR optimization top of mind each budget season.
More CIOs are investing in population health systems in conjunction with their clinical teams to help keep patients healthy â€“ while managing the quality and cost imperatives of value-based care.
This ongoing series offers in-depth interviews with CIOs and other technology leaders to learn about the priorities they set with their investments in six categories: AI and machine learning; interoperability; telehealth, connected health and remote patient monitoring; cybersecurity; electronic health records and population health; and precision medicine and emerging technology.
Dr. Samit Desai, chief medical information officer at Ascension, a national health system operating more than 2,600 sites of care in 19 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
