<p>The healthcare industry has experienced several real clinical and financial benefits accruing from the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Acting as reliable digital repositories of crucial patient data, EHRs promote appropriate care decisions while reducing medical errors. However, clinicians are worried about the workload that accompanies EHRs. They are particularly concerned about its time-consuming nature, which accounts for one of the factors contributing to physician burnout.</p><p>I beg to differ, though. I believe physician burnout can be effectively addressed if you deploy the right EHR and optimize it to the best of its capabilities and features. An optimal EHR will ease off your burdens and reduce frustrations rather than aggravating them. Here’s how:</p><h2><strong>Configure your EHR to your needs and workflows</strong></h2><p>The majority of EHRs come in a ‘one size fits all’ model. Make sure you don’t fall prey to this. Such systems fail to adapt well to different sized practices and specialties. Neither can they accommodate varying patient populations. The result is an added burden on the physician using the system. The solution is relatively simple. Get your EHR configured to your practice’s workflows, patient population, and institutional needs. Get it customized to include the content and modules that you require for streamlining your workflows.</p>
