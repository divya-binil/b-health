<p>To promote the use of its OEC 3D Imaging System, GE HealthCare and Johnson &amp; Johnson have created a distribution agreement. The C-arm can be used for cardiac and vascular treatments, but the new agreement is concentrated on its usage for imaging spinal procedures, particularly those using equipment from J&amp;J's DePuy Synthes division. The agreement to provide OEC 3D systems and DePuy Synthes devices to American surgeons is a part of GE HealthCare's aim to secure product distribution by collaborating with businesses that already have a presence in important markets.</p><p>OEC 3D is made to take 2D and 3D photos to help with surgeries like stent implantation and spinal fusion. The portable system is made to produce CT-like pictures while doing surgeries.</p>
