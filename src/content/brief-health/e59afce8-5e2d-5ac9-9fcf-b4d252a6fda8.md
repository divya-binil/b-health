<p>The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) has rolled out a new initiative that seeks to standardize the healthcare data sets federal agencies with specific needs that aren’t being addressed by the current baseline.</p><p>Called <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/topic/interoperability/uscdi-plus"><strong>USCDI+</strong></a>, the initiative builds on the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI), <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi#uscdi-v1"><strong>the first version of which</strong></a> was adopted as part of the ONC’s 21st Century Cures Act Final Rule.</p><p>This new process will support federal partners “who have a need to establish, harmonize and advance the use of interoperable datasets that extend beyond the core data in the USCDI in order to meet agency-specific programmatic requirements,” ONC wrote in an announcement blog post.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Coordinating this identification and establishment process through the formal USCDI+ initiative will allow ONC to ensure any additions to federal partners’ data requirements are built from a singular USCDI foundation, the office wrote.</p>
