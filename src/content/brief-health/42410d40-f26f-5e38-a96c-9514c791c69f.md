<p>INDIANAPOLIS,&nbsp;Feb. 23, 2018&nbsp;/PRNewswire/ — VoCare, Inc., an&nbsp;Indiana-based company, has developed the world’s first professional-grade medical diagnostic device which collects 6 different health vitals and is equipped with WiFi, Bluetooth, 4G LTE for data transmission, without the need for separate peripherals or an external hub. The Vitals360 device, comparable in size to an iPhone, is the first and only telehealth solution that can be used for both Point-of-Care and Remote Patient Monitoring. The VoCare platform leverages one connected device to empower the management of multiple chronic conditions such as diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. The Vitals360 device provides the following vital measurements: (1) Blood Glucose, (2) Blood Pressure, (3) Pulse, (4) Oximetry, (5) Temperature, and (6) Electrocardiography (ECG).</p><p>The VoCare Vitals360 runs on Android OS powered by Qualcomm chipsets, allowing the device to be used with virtually any wireless carrier worldwide such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, Rogers, and Vodafone. Moreover, the Vitals360 can be utilized with numerous backend solutions.&nbsp;Steven R. Peabody, CEO of VoCare states, “We are looking forward to helping providers reduce healthcare costs as well as ensuring better outcomes for their exploding chronically ill patient population.”</p><p>GEMMS, of Harris Computer Systems&nbsp;<a href="http://www.harriscomputer.com/">http://www.harriscomputer.com/,&nbsp;</a>a division of Constellation Software, Inc., recognizes that the Vitals360 will enable healthcare professionals to meet the requirements of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Transitional Care and Chronic Care management programs, as well as to be positioned for the use of electronic information and mobile technologies to support remote clinical healthcare and other healthcare delivery functions as proposed in the Chronic Care Act.</p><p>GEMMS will debut the Vitals360 solution at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems (HIMMS) conference in&nbsp;March 2018&nbsp;<a href="http://www.himss.org/">http://www.himss.org/.</a>&nbsp; Booth 5446&nbsp;<a href="https://www.harrishealthcare.com/himss18/#page">https://www.harrishealthcare.com/himss18/#page</a>.</p><p>Rodger P. Pinto, Ph.D., Executive Vice President of GEMMS indicates, “The VoCare Vitals360 device along with GEMMS extensive experience in data management and interoperability will allow patient data to be captured easily from anywhere, at any time and sent in real-time to providers.”</p><p>Ben H. Park, MD, CEO of American Health Network states, “I am excited not only by the robust capability but even more so by how easy this product is to deploy. I can literally hand one to a patient in the office and that day they can be transmitting me the things I need to help manage common chronic conditions.”</p><p>Todd Stallings, Vice President for Home Services Unlimited, an&nbsp;Indiana-based home healthcare company, states, “The VoCare solution’s versatility as a point-of-care device or as a remote patient monitoring solution is a disrupting force in the home healthcare market.”</p><p>VoCare is in the process of obtaining its CE mark and FDA&nbsp;510k&nbsp;Clearance and is on track for U.S. sales in the coming months.
