<p>Study will analyze whether cognitive behavioral therapy telehealth can lower headache days and disability as effectively as cognitive behavioral therapy plus a preventive medication for migraine.
A new study will analyze the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered via telehealth in decreasing total headache days and disability from migraine vs CBT plus a preventive medication.
The researchers, led by Scott Powers, PhD, Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, Cincinnati Childrenâ€™s Hospital Medical Center, will analyze whether CBT telehealth can lower headache days and disability as effectively as CBT telehealth plus amitriptyline, a preventive medication for migraine.</p>
