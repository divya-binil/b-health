<p>Sarah Boyd from Norfolk and Waveney Health and Social Care Partnership, explores how her ICS is using digital to improve patient inclusion and more.<br><br>Sarah Boyd, head of digital experience and transformation at Norfolk and Waveney Health and Social Care Partnership, explores how her ICS is using digital to improve patient inclusion and help reduce health inequalities.
I’ve always been passionate about digital inclusion and equitable access and outcomes.
We work across the public sector, with health and social care, councils and with voluntary organisations.
Our plan is to gain the wider benefits of digital inclusion by engaging people – not only in health services – but more broadly in society.
If you’re an elderly person, for example, and your GP detects you’re socially isolated, they can refer you to a central digital inclusion service.
We need to build a future where every service is digitally inclusive.
As the Good Things Foundation Widening Digital Participation report found in March 2020, digital inclusion pays for itself in better mental and physical health, and stronger participation in the economy.
Digital inclusivity should be available to all.</p>
