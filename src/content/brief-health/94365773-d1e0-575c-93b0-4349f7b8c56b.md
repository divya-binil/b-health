<p>Are you ready for an RFID implant? Here’s everything what you should know about RFID chips before you implant them into your body.<br><br>Wannabe-cyborgs with little RFID chips under their skin are living with us: thousands of people have implanted the tiny devices already under their skin to be able to have simpler access to buildings or (other people’s) phones.
Here’s what you should know about RFID chips before you implant them into your body.
Captain Cyborg and the RFID implant
Dogs getting pedicured in New York or cows living on the ranch near Ohio have been on the way to cyborgization for years – as they are most likely RFID chipped for identification.
Approximately two decades later, the technology has been made commercially available, and thousands of people decided to implant an RFID chip.
In the future, an RFID chip implanted into your hand, between your thumb and your index finger on the back of your hand, could contain a lot of useful information – that you usually carry around in your wallet or purse.
“I use my microchip to store my medical records and work portfolio, as well as to use it as a crypto wallet and to unlock doors” – says Brandon Dalaly about his implant in this article.
In any case, if you think it’s lame to get access to the office through entrance cards, you might convince your boss to order RFID chips from Dangerous Things, an online store that sells four different implantable transponders, and the place where most people buy their implants.</p>
