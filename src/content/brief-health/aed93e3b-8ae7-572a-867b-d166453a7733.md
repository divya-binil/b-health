<p>Wellness and preventative care is a difficult component of patient health to build consistent habits around&nbsp; – particularly for underserved communities. <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/49116/2000178-How-are-Income-and-Wealth-Linked-to-Health-and-Longevity.pdf">Per the Urban Institute</a>, low income adults are almost 5x as likely to report being in fair or poor health as adults with household incomes at or above 400% of the federal poverty level. Low-income American adults also have high rates of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and other chronic disorders compared to wealthier Americans.</p><p>There’s opportunity for digital technology to build a greater sense of literacy around what wellness means, and to help create consistent preventative practices to improve and maintain good health. However, we can’t just innovate for innovation’s sake. The last thing the world needs is another health tracking app. Effective, actionable, and sustainable change requires real conversations with real people in underserved communities to truly understand (and design) sustainable solutions.</p><p>We collaborated with <a href="https://www.grapevinehealth.com/">Grapevine Health</a> Founder and CEO, Dr. Lisa Fitzpatrick, to go ‘on the street’ to talk to people about the myriad challenges and experiences facing underserved patient populations and use those conversations as fuel for innovation.</p>
