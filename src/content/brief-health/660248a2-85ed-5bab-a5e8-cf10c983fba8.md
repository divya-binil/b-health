<p>In collaboration with Princess Alexandra Hospital and Metro South Health, the researchers harnessed EMR data to develop the said tool that can predict when a patient's vital signs are likely to reach a danger zone, leading to their decline. In the Asia-Pacific region, Apollo Hospitals has also used AI/ML to harness a large set of patient data in developing a tool to predict disease risk.</p>
