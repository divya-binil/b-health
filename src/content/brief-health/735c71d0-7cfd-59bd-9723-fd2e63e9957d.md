<p>Genomics is one of the most exciting parts of healthcare.&nbsp; It’s also one of the most complex and challenging topics out there.&nbsp; As genomic sequencing prices have dropped and genomic research has accelerated, I know of no area of healthcare that’s more exciting than genomics.</p><p>While genomics has shown so much progress and promise, I’ll admit that any genomics discussion gets complex really quickly.&nbsp; With that complexity, I’ve always wondered how EHR vendors were going to approach genomics.&nbsp; We all know that genomic medicine will eventually get to the bedside, but how it was going to get there wasn’t clear to me.&nbsp; In fact, I’d often talk about EHR APIs and say that these APIs were needed because there was no way an EHR vendor was going to do all that was needed for genomic medicine (let alone hundreds of other third party apps).</p>
