<p>For health IT to benefit health and healthcare, it must be useable by – and useful to – patients and clinicians.&nbsp; This is precisely where the discipline of human factors and ergonomics (HFE) serves as an essential foundation for the development, implementation, and use of high-quality health information systems and practices.&nbsp; HFE improves overall performance through study of interactions among humans and other elements of a system.</p><p>We recently published a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32342896/"><strong>forward-looking article</strong></a> in a special issue of Applied Ergonomics<i>, </i>reviewing key initiatives funded by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).&nbsp; In the article, we illustrate how HFE methods and approaches can improve the design, implementation, and use of health IT for clinicians and consumers and identify the work that remains.</p>
