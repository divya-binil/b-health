<p>The term "digital transformation" is currently very popular in the healthcare industry. We had to rush to discover digital alternatives to numerous tasks during the epidemic in order to be safe. So, although healthcare has advanced significantly in recent years, there is still potential for improvement. Certain regions have been unsupported for some businesses as a result of a hasty search for a digital solution. Due to this rush, some organisations have not yet embraced the same procedures that patients have learned to adore and are currently attempting to do so. Therefore, even though we have achieved great strides in the field of digital transformation, much work remains.</p>
