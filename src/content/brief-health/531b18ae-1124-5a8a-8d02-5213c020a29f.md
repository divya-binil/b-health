<p>For physicians, administrative overload is all too common and its effects are insidious. EHR systems, optimized for billing rather than documenting information quickly and effectively at the point of care, aren't supportive in capturing clinical notes. Administrative overload is all too frequent for doctors, and its repercussions are subtle. EHR systems aren't helpful in taking clinical notes since they are designed for invoicing rather than promptly and accurately documenting information at the time of service. As a result, fragmented documentation has become a heavier burden, which has left doctors worn out. This is a problem that healthcare officials cannot afford to ignore. New platforms powered by artificial intelligence are now available to help doctors finish documentation more quickly and concentrate on what really matters: caring for their patients. Jared Dodd, MD, the medical director of Central Virginia Family Doctors Medical Group (Lynchburg, Va.), was recently interviewed by Becker's Healthcare to find out how his company has lowered the administrative burden on its clinicians.</p>
