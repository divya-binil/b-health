<p>AI is not the future but the present, according to Patient Safety Virtual 2021 speaker Dr Samer Ellahham - and it is here to provide support to caregivers.<br><br>Addressing a special session on “The role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in Patient Safety” at the three-day Patient Safety Virtual 2021 conference that started today, Dr Samer Ellahham, Medical Director of Continuous Improvement, Director of Accreditation, Cleveland Clinic Caregiver, Senior Cardiovascular Consultant, Heart and Vascular Institute, Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, UAE said that integrating AI into healthcare can make processes a whole lot more efficient.
“If AI is integrated into medical records of patients, it will be very helpful for a caregiver,” he said.
Allaying common concerns of machines taking over jobs of humans, Dr Ellahham said that AI is not here to replace humans but to provide support by making processes more efficient and precise while dealing with a large number of data to make not only appropriate suggestions, but also predictions.
In future, the term AI in healthcare will not exist but will be called augmented healthcare or intelligence based medicine.”&nbsp;</p>
