The Gravitas Network includes a comprehensive, clinically validated patient-level social determinants of health (SDoH) dataset, a current and robust mortality dataset, and one of the largest multi-sourced, de-identified medical claims datasets in the U.S. The network is powered by the “Gravitas Token,” which LexisNexis describes as a “next-generation, HIPAA-compliant token that securely links de-identified datasets with increased accuracy.” While other tokens link data using probabilistic matching, the company noted, the Gravitas Token leverages a referential data layer to help ensure the right records are precisely matched and linked over time. Truveta – An early adopter of the Gravitas Token, Truveta is a collective of 24 U.S. health systems representing 16 percent of clinical data in the U.S. Truveta is using the Gravitas Token to connect de-identified patient records linked across health systems with socioeconomic, mortality, and claims data to advance patient care and improve health equity. “We see an enormous opportunity to leverage our core datasets and advanced linking technology to create more person-centric real-world data to advance clinical research and improve the future of healthcare,” said Jeff Diamond, president and general manager of the Health Care business of LexisNexis Risk Solutions, in a statement.
