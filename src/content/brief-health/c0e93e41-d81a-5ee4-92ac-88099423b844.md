<p>juli, the AI-powered chronic condition platform, released the results of a first-of-its-kind analysis demonstrating a 55 percent reduction in the number of people with bipolar disorder who experience symptoms of mania after only eight weeks using the juli app.
Despite the prevalence and severity of the disorder, an analysis of bipolar disorder apps published in the International Journal of Bipolar Disorder in 2020, before juli was available, found that there are few evidence-based clinically usable apps available to help with its management.
As of July 2022, 2,987 people with bipolar disorder had downloaded the juli app.
The analysis covers a six-month period and includes results from 208 juli users who were previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder by a physician and who completed baseline and week-8 surveys.
</p><p>"This analysis of bipolar users is just one of many examples of how juli is helping our users to understand the triggers and levers that help them keep their conditions stable."
The research team at juli has also developed machine learning models for predicting users' ASRM and PHQ-8 score from the data collected by the app in the week before the assessment.
juli harnesses AI to provide people with chronic conditions and their caregivers powerful insights into behavioral patterns that impact their health, pinpointing triggers that make a complex, multifactorial condition worse and identifying changes that can help avoid or alleviate a flare-up.
juli is an AI-driven next-gen chronic condition management platform for multi-factorial and comorbid conditions, currently covering asthma, migraine, chronic pain, hypertension, depression and bipolar disorder.</p>
