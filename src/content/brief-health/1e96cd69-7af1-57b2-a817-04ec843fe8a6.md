<p>David Rambo, Founder &amp; Chief Executive Officer at Simplex Health shares best practices we put in place to make telehealth work for everyone.&nbsp;<br><br>As the founder of a startup that works with a number of large healthcare systems, our ability to see patients virtually (via telehealth) is not only what kept us afloat, but the very thing that allowed us to expand our reach far outside of our providersâ€™ service areas.
Now, with telehealth, dietitians can literally meet patients right where they are: providing recipe ideas, taking stock of their pantry, even virtually grocery shopping with patients to take the stress out of meal planning.</p>
