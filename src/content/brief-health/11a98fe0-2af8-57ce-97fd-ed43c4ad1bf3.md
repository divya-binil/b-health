<p>The global health insurance market has been experiencing a declining growth rate in recent years; from 9% in 2014-2015 to 6-7% in subsequent years. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/reenitadas/2019/02/04/the-top-five-digital-health-technologies-in-2019/">2019 Forbes report</a> that pointed this out also attributes this decline partly to the low adoption of digital solutions in this sector. But those very same solutions can <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/technologies-change-health-insurance-innovative-ventures/">transform the market</a>.</p><p>Already with futuristic technologies like clinical grade personal health sensors, at-home genome sequencing kits and artificial intelligence, healthcare is receiving a much-needed overhaul that democratises access to quality care. The health insurance industry could also ride on those same waves of disruption to make the market relevant again in the digital health age.</p><p>But as these solutions make the landscape more data-focused, new issues about privacy and whether the new insurance systems the technologies help create will be used to discriminate against patients. We contemplate these aspects and more in this article exploring the influence of digital health on health insurance.</p>
