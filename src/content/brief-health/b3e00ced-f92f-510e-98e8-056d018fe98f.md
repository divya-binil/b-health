<p>Sprinter Health, a mobile diagnostics and on-demand health company that brings individualised and affordable healthcare services to the home, today announced a partnership with Firefly Health, a health plan and virtual-first care innovator with a mission to deliver half-priced health care that's twice as good, clinically and emotionally. Through the integration of Sprinter Health's in-home clinical services into Firefly Health's virtual primary care, the alliance seeks to increase access to treatment while reducing costs in the long run. In the US, it is still difficult to obtain adequate preventive care because 124 million adults have gone more than a year without seeing a primary care physician, 34 million people have diabetes and 21% of those cases go undiagnosed, and 33 million persons are unaware they have kidney disease1. It is obvious that the usual primary care process is ineffective.</p>
