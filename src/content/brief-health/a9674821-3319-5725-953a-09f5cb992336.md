<p>Filippo Falaschi, senior consultant, digital health and med tech investment management firm Spex Capital
There’s no doubt the pandemic served as a major catalyst in the development and adoption of digital health technologies at speed and scale.
The rise of digital health solutions aimed at facilitating delivery of healthcare services will spill over from 2021.
It’s been a tougher year than expected for most digital health firms.
Though for several years, we have seen digital health solutions adopted into health systems, the COVID pandemic undoubtedly created a surge in the adoption of these technologies, which we will see continue in 2022.
Specifically, patients with acute conditions such as pneumonia and chronic diseases like heart failure will be able to be safely monitored in home environments using digital health solutions that provide care teams with real-time data.
Three areas we will see AI having a greater impact include clinical decision support tools in radiology, remote patient monitoring systems and digital pathology.</p>
