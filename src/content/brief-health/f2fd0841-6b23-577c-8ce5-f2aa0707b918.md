title: What Can Healthcare IT Leaders Do To Flip the Script on Physician Burnout?
---

On Monday, June 3, leaders from the Wilmington, Delaware-based Nemours Children’s Health System engaged in a broad panel discussion around physician well-being, at the Mid-Atlantic Health IT Summit, being held at the Hilton City Avenue Hotel in Philadelphia, and sponsored by Healthcare Innovation. The executives’ panel session was entitled “How Physician Informatics Can Increase Engagement and Address Burnout.”

Immediately after their presentation, the panelists sat down for an interview Healthcare Innovation Editor-in-Chief Mark Hagland. The Nemours executives were Gina Altieri, senior vice president and chief of strategy integration; David West, MD., medical director, health informatics; Matt Di Guglielmo, M.D., chief, Division of General Pediatrics, Department of Pediatrics; and Sara Slovin, M.D., a primary care physician in the Department of Pediatrics. Below are excerpts from that interview.
