<p>From track-and-trace systems to digital Covid vaccination passports, to patient data, to the medical supply chain, there has been a huge increase in data collected by governments and healthcare providers.
Integrating new innovations in data privacy into global systems gives healthcare providers the opportunity to focus on what really matters: the provision of healthcare.
When applied to healthcare data, healthcare providers, practitioners, insurers, pharmaceutical companies, and any other relevant parties can maintain contact with targeted individual users without knowing exactly who those users are.
Of course, the unique combination of MPC technology and blockchain, cannot provide solutions to all of the woes suffered by global healthcare systems.</p>
