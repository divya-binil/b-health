<p>As they say, new year, new beginnings; and this also applies to the field of digital health!
So to get ready for this new year full of digital health potentials, let’s take a peek at 5 fields to expect medical innovation and developments out of.
This is the technology that startup Sonaphi is employing in its app that aims to detect potential COVID-19 infections based on vocal features.
We could thus see more such voice-tech apps to be released this year that might potentially help identify conditions beyond COVID-19.
This approach can help develop new cures for conditions with faulty proteins.
Their A.I. previously helped predict the risk of developing acute kidney disease 2 days before it manifests based on patients’ medical records and lab results.
During the pandemic, smart algorithms have also proven their worth in assisting healthcare professionals to distinguish those who could have been infected with COVID-19 from those with less threatening conditions.
From microbiome analyses to whole-genome sequencing, such at-home lab tests provide crucial, personalised health information in a private and convenient manner; while lifting off additional pressure on healthcare institutions.</p>
