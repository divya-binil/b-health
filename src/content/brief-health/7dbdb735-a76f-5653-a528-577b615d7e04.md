<p>According to a research by Chartis and Kythera Labs of millions of claims between 2020 and 2022, telehealth currently represents 10% of all outpatient visits, up from 1% before the pandemic, suggesting that it is a permanent and significant fixture in U.S. healthcare delivery. "The fact that telehealth usage has stabilised at 10% shows that providers have recognised the modality's worth and are actively choosing to use it more than they were before the pandemic. According to Bret Anderson, principal at Chartis, "in the future, we anticipate providers to identify additional use cases that will have an impact on how virtual care is experienced."</p>
