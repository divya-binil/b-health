<p>The system was cleared for use among individuals 12 years old and up with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes on multiple-dose injection therapy.<br><br>The system was cleared for use among individuals 12 years old and up with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who use multiple-dose injection therapy.</p><p>Included in the Bigfoot Unity System are two smartpen caps for both rapid- and long-acting insulin, a connected mobile app, an integrated FreeStyle Libre 2 Sensor from Abbott and a blood glucose meter.</p><p>What sets Bigfoot’s system apart is the smartpen caps that take data from the FreeStyle Libre 2 continuous glucose monitor to give users insulin dose recommendations based on a physician’s instructions. To use the smartpen cap for rapid-acting insulin, users scan the FreeStyle Libre 2 sensor and the pen cap displays their current glucose value as well as any recommended correction doses.</p><p>The Unity System also provides reminders for long-acting insulin doses and notifications for when a person’s glucose level is too low. All of the data is stored and shared with the Bigfoot app for users and their healthcare providers to view their health history.</p><p>Additionally, Bigfoot’s smartpen caps are compatible with all major U.S. brands of rap</p>
