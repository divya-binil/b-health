<p>Boots pharmacists will be provided with HIMSS virtual modules covering subjects including the benefits of digital healthcare for patients, how to quickly adopt digital solutions in a community pharmacy and the future of digital health.
Since the pandemic, Boots has launched several digital platforms enabling customers to access pharmacy services remotely, including a video pharmacy consultation service for people with cancer and an online video consultation platform via the LIVI app to connect patients and pharmacists.
The HIMSS accreditation will put Boots will among the first community pharmacists in the UK to help influence the direction of digital healthcare.</p>
