<p>Digital health investors and innovators should focus on solutions to simplify the complicated U.S. healthcare system for patients.<br><br>Calling the U.S. healthcare system complex&nbsp;would be like calling the universe big: an understatement that poorly conveys its true scale. It's populated with primary care physicians, specialists, pharmacists, insurance companies, labs, therapists, caregivers and others – all using different tools, methods of communication and care delivery solutions.</p><p>Our healthcare system attempts to deliver coordinated service from distant silos, hoping for better health outcomes.</p><p><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/05/01/2020-05050/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act-interoperability-and">Recent policies</a> have aimed to synthesize the back end&nbsp;of healthcare in order to give stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem better visibility and simplified coordination. This systems-level approach is welcome and will likely yield results that make healthcare more efficient and effective.</p><p>What’s missing, however, is a simplified experience for the end user navigating the healthcare journey: the patient. Currently, the patient carries the burden of ensuring these systems, their providers and caregivers work seamlessly together.</p><p>Think about the challenges you or a loved one faced during a transition in the healthcare journey: moving from one insurance plan to another, from wellness maintenance to addressing a disease, or shifting out of acute medical care to rehabilitation or chronic-condition management.</p>
