title: How to Achieve Digital Transformation in Healthcare

Hospitals are busy places, but there’s still room for disruption, says Dr. Rod Hochman. 

As the president and CEO of Providence St. Joseph Health — the nation’s third-largest health system — Hochman has worked to foster a consumer-focused culture, secure a multiyear strategic partnership with Microsoft and recruit talent from tech giants. 

Designed to improve care delivery tools and shift how patients maintain good health at home, an effective disruption, he notes, is driven by “the four D’s”: deconstruction, diversification, digitization and delivery.
