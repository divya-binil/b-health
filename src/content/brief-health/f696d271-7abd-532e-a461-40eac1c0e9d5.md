<p>I just bought a new cell phone (The <a href="https://amzn.to/3yHn0bf">Google Pixel 4a</a> for those that wonder and yes, it says a lot about me).&nbsp; I’m an Android user and always have been an Android user.&nbsp; I also use Google voice, so switching phones was easy.&nbsp; I logged in with my Google account and everything was ready to go (Note: there’s probably a lesson here for Healthcare too).&nbsp; I had to log into a few apps and redo my home screen, but that’s about it.</p><p>What was interesting about this experience is that I realized that I had 163 apps installed on my phone.&nbsp; 163!&nbsp; I couldn’t believe it.&nbsp; Talk about app proliferation.&nbsp; As I thought about it, there are probably 5-10 apps (email, social, maps, text, scriptures) that I use every day or at least multiple times a week.&nbsp; There are 15-20 apps I use a few times a month (food, flight, documents, games).&nbsp; The rest of the apps I use pretty rarely.&nbsp; While there are some I should get rid of (old conference apps), most of them are things that I may use in the future (parking app) so there’s no reason for me to get rid of them.&nbsp; However, they play such a little part of my day that they certainly don’t influence my life.</p>
