<p>The Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) released a threat profile on Evil Corp (AKA UNC2165) - one of the most efficient cybercriminal syndicates globally.
Evil Corp is responsible for developing and operating several of the most powerful malware and ransomware variants and has strong relationships with other cybercriminal groups and the Russian government.
It is entirely plausible that Evil Corp could be tasked with acquiring intellectual property from the U.S. health sector using such means at the behest of the Russian government.”
Benczkowski characterized some of Evil Corp's actions as having, “deployed two of the most damaging pieces of financial malware ever used and resulted in tens of millions of dollars of losses to victims worldwide’ and being, ‘the perpetrators behind the world’s most egregious cyberattacks,’ and having targeted victims across the globe in, ‘one of the most widespread malware campaigns we have ever encountered.’ The State Department and FBI have a standing offer of $5 million for information leading to the arrest and conviction of their leader, Maksim Yakubets, which is the largest reward for a cybercriminal ever offered.”
“Evil Corp have operated a number of prominent malware and ransomware variants over their history and as such, the list of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) they leverage is wide,” the threat profile notes.</p>
