<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><main id="genesis-content"><article aria-label="Activ Surgical Granted Third U.S. Patent for ActivSight™ Imaging Module"><div> <p><strong>Author:</strong> Tom Calef, <em>CTO, Activ Surgical</em></p>    <p>Today marks yet another milestone in Activ Surgical’s history as we announce that the company was issued its third patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for our ActivSight<sup>TM </sup>interoperable imaging module. The ActivSight module is designed to interface with existing vision systems to enable surgeons to view in real-time critical physiological structures and functions, like blood flow, that cannot be seen with the naked eye while in the operating room.</p>    <p>Our first U.S. patent for the ActivSight imaging module was <a href="https://www.activsurgical.com/news/activ-surgical-granted-first-u-s-patent-for-activsight-enhanced-visualization-module">issued in March of 2021</a>, with a <a href="https://www.activsurgical.com/news/second-patent-for-activsight-imaging-module">second patent granted</a> in November 2021. This third patent – U.S. Patent No. 11,206,991 – was issued in December 2021 and protects our proprietary system and methods for processing laser speckle signals, which are currently delivered via the ActivSight module. This patent protects our intellectual property that provides intraoperative visual data and images on blood flow and perfusion not currently available to surgeons through existing technologies. The three patents are mission-critical for Activ Surgical and bring us one step closer to our goal of enhancing patient outcomes and democratizing surgical care around the world.&nbsp;I am incredibly proud of our staff, particularly the inventors of this technology, John Oberlin and Manny DeMaio. As a company, we have many patents pending for our inventions worldwide, which cements our position as a disruptor in the digital surgery space. Stay tuned for more news from Activ Surgical as we march towards commercial availability of the ActivSight module later this year.</p> <!--<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 			xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 			xmlns:trackback="http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="https://www.activsurgical.com/news/activ-surgical-granted-third-u-s-patent-for-activsight-imaging-module"     dc:identifier="https://www.activsurgical.com/news/activ-surgical-granted-third-u-s-patent-for-activsight-imaging-module"     dc:title="Activ Surgical Granted Third U.S. Patent for ActivSight™ Imaging Module"     trackback:ping="https://www.activsurgical.com/news/activ-surgical-granted-third-u-s-patent-for-activsight-imaging-module/trackback" /> </rdf:RDF>--> </div></article></main></div></div></div>
