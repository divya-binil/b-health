<p>"Physician wellness has been a core priority at CAMH, and as part of our mission to 'bring joy back to medicine,' there has been a natural focus on addressing the inefficiencies of practice in our EHR as the first step," said Brian Lo, doctoral student and CIHR Health Systems Impact Fellow at CAMH, in an interview with Healthcare IT News.
"Through the physician engagement strategy at CAMH, we hope to inspire a workforce of 'hybrid' physicians who will not just address these inefficiencies of practice, but bring leadership and change to the EHR to reimagine efficient and effective mental health care," Lo added.
Lo, who will be going into more detail about the response with CAMH Chief Medical Information Officer Dr. Tania Tajirian at HIMSS22 next month, explained that as digital health has rapidly evolved, so has the team's strategy.
"Empowering physicians to drive change and transform care through the EHR will pave the way to sustained impact and success," she said.</p>
