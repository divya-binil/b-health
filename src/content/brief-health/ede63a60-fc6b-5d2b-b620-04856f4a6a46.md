<p>To help cope with the social distancing measures put in place to help flatten the curve of COVID-19 infections, the <a href="https://healthcaretransformers.com/digital-health/covid-19-solutions-technologies/">healthcare industry had to adapt</a> quickly.

Key trends have emerged surrounding the use of the technology that will continue to shape the future of telehealth services.</p><p>Simply put, telehealth uses communication technology to deliver healthcare services to patients without the need to be in the same physical location such as video chat via apps or webcams, phones, or video conference software.1 Prior to the pandemic, telehealth services were generally limited adhoc services with a large range of restrictions.2 Originally, they were created to support rural and underserved patients gain access to specialists when local help was severely limited.3 Jump forward to 2020-2021, and telehealth is becoming widespread across all aspects of the industry.&nbsp;</p>
