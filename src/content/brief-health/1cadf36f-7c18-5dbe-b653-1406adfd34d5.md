The COVID-19 pandemic offers an opportunity for a practice and policy "reset" to help permanently reduce administrative headaches for physicians, according to a commentary in published in Health Affairs.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, regulators and payers have relaxed or modified long-standing policies to ease documentation burdens for doctors. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced in early April a series of rules that aimed to remove regulatory burdens facing providers swamped with treating the COVID-19 outbreak.

At the top of the list of impactful changes is the waiver from CMSÂ of policies regarding verbal orders.
