<p>Zus also announced a partnership with primary care tech company Elation Health. Jonathan Bush, a seasoned leader in digital health, secured $40 million in funding for his health data platform Zus Health. JAZZ Venture Partners, F-Prime Capital, Maverick Ventures, and Andreessen Horowitz participated in the fundraising (a16z). Zus is a platform that aims to connect health data so that healthcare professionals may obtain a single view of their patients' histories, including information on their coverage, care team, and medications. The business intends to use the most recent round of funding to develop workflow and referral tools, add new data sources, and create integration paths that will allow providers to leverage external patient data. According to the CEO of Zus, "We have discovered a critically crucial function for Zus as the common knowledge base behind the many fantastic electronic medical records, CRMs, and patient care technologies that healthcare works with."</p>
