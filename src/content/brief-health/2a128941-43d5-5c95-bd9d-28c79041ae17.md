<p>A healthy healthcare industry is key to keeping inflation down and avoiding recession, Zandi said at HIMSS23 on Friday. Despite workforce challenges and cost pressures, he's optimistic AI and automation can help boost productivity. "I'm assuming that the main query you have for me is whether or not there will be a recession. If so, when will it begin and how severe will it be? At HIMSS23 on Friday, Moody's Analytics cofounder and chief economist Mark Zandi made the following statement. "There's a lot of talk about the recession," he remarked. "In fact, I don't think I've ever seen so many people so pessimistic about the economy going forward in the more than 30 years that I've been a professional economist," the analyst said. "I'm going to argue that even though the next 12 to 18 months will be challenging, I think we have quite a chance to make progress in that time. However, I think it's important not to be overly optimistic about what lies ahead."</p>
