<p>HT: Telehealth stepped into the forefront of the healthcare industry during the COVID pandemic, now that we are seeing the return of normality in our lives, what are the current key trends in telehealth that will become standard to care delivery?
Dr. Vin Gupta: I’ll say that as a clinician, this movement toward enhanced patient engagement with telehealth as a substitute for services routinely provided in brick and mortar facilities has permanently changed our healthcare delivery system.
Now we’re seeing over 53 million Medicare enrollees in the United States engage in some form of telehealth service, up 63x fold from pre-pandemic levels (840K).1 So behavior change on the part of the patient is clearly changing with the times and driving increased utilization of telehealth and the future trends of telehealth.</p>
