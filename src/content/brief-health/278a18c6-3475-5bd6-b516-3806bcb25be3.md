<p>Onehome, which Humana acquired last year, will coordinate in-home care services for Humana Medicare Advantage plan members in Virginia, working with existing home care providers in the market. Humana Inc. recently announced it is expanding its onehome value-based home care model to Virginia.
Onehome, a subsidiary of Humana, will coordinate in-home care services for Humana Medicare Advantage plan members in Virginia, working with existing home care providers in the market.
“Onehome’s value-based approach relieves patients and physicians from the burden of dealing with multiple providers of home health services, including medication and equipment, which is the common experience for those currently navigating the extremely fragmented home health industry,” said Ramon Falero, CEO and Co-Founder of onehome, in a statement.
