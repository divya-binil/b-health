<p>Many health organizations are working to get patient information flowing more seamlessly, but data overload can frustrate clinicians. In a HIMSS23 Views from the Top session preview, athenahealth CEO Bob Segert offers thoughts on how IT can help. All medical organisations should promote interoperability in order to establish a fully integrated healthcare ecosystem. Healthcare organisations are driving interoperability innovations to improve patient outcomes and physician experiences. According to athenahealth CEO Bob Segert, a HIMSS23 anchor exhibitor, while government programmes like the 21st Century Cures Act and CMS' Fostering Interoperability Programs are advancing the business, the regulations merely set a minimum level. Segert will be joined by Clive Fields, co-founder and chief medical officer of VillageMD, and Scott Middleton, founder of SC House Calls, for a Views from the Top Session on "Intuitive Interoperability and Improved Patient Outcomes" to discuss new data applications with an eye towards better outcomes. Improved connectivity and clarity are desired by doctors. We recently conducted a position sentiment poll.</p>
