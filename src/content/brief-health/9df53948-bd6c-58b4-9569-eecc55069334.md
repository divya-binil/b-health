<p>A. While 2021 saw many healthcare technology mergers and acquisitions in response to the pandemic, and growing virtual-care adoption among payers, providers and consumers, much of the technology of these combined entities remains fractured.
The technology for virtual-care appointments also will continue to advance beyond 1:1 doctor-patient video conferencing.
Whether it's behavioral, acute or chronic care, the most important role that technology will play is enabling all physicians to have the same window into a patient's medical history and care plan so they can provide integrated, longitudinal care.
The technology is what will enable this industry to realize the full potential of virtual care beyond transactional, one-time interactions.
What do you foresee happening with reimbursement for virtual care in 2022?
A. With usage rates 38 times higher than pre-pandemic, and the inarguable value for the people who need it most – seniors and the immunocompromised who can't afford in-person exposure – I believe the government will and should expand virtual-care access.</p>
