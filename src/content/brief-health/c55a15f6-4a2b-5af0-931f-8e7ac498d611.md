<p>Many organizations remain behind the curve with adopting new technologies and service development, especially when it comes to point of care. Following a turbulent few years, point of care adoption and clinical service maturity must be expected across the healthcare landscape. There could be a lot of variables at work. Is there any evidence against the use of point-of-care and quick diagnostics, or is the opposing view the correct one? In order to provide context for why some businesses continue to lag behind in implementing new technologies and developing services, this article analyses various perspectives and points of view.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What actions can</strong><i><strong> </strong></i><strong>executives do to support POCT adoption and prosperity</strong></p><h3><strong>Overcoming the barriers to adoption</strong></h3><p>Point of care adoption of new technologies can hinge on attitudes toward clinical risk, faith in the methodology, and appropriate use of tests within a well-governed structure. The executive team will be well placed to understand the opportunities and benefits of introducing point of care testing and should consider the following actions:</p><ol><li>Address any clinical concerns and opinions around deploying point of care diagnostics</li><li>Assess the clinical risk of both introducing and not introducing point of care solutions</li><li>Request and support business cases for the development and expansion of POCT</li><li>Introduce initiatives to promote point of care testing as a discipline of pathology and biomedical science</li><li>Review success stories of where point of care diagnostics has contributed to improved patient care, hospital flow, and medical outcomes</li></ol><p>In achieving the above, the result is likely to be improved interest in point of care activities which will improve the understanding of the impact on healthcare delivery..&nbsp;There are several technological advancements that have driven the adoption of point-of-care (POC) testing. These include:</p><ul><li>Miniaturization of laboratory equipment: Small, portable devices that can perform various types of tests (e.g., blood glucose, pregnancy, influenza) have made it easier to perform POC testing in a variety of settings.</li><li>Improvement in test accuracy: Advances in POC test design and manufacturing have led to tests that are more accurate and reliable than in the past.</li><li>Increased use of electronic medical records: Electronic medical records (EMRs) make it easier to collect, store, and access patient data, which can be useful for POC testing.</li><li>Development of rapid test methods: Many POC tests can produce results in a matter of minutes, which is much faster than traditional laboratory testing. This can be especially important for time-sensitive situations, such as in the case of acute infections.</li><li>Increased focus on patient-centered care: POC testing can help to improve patient satisfaction by providing quicker results and allowing patients to receive treatment more quickly. This has contributed to the adoption of POC testing in healthcare settings.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
