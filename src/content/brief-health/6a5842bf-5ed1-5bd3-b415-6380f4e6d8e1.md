With a surge in patients at hospitals and emergency rooms, providers and support staff are constantly under stress with limited time to gather patient health information. Interoperability would enable providers to quickly and seamlessly access a patient’s medical record either through their electronic health record (EHR) or directly from the patient’s phone. 

Interoperability is meant to streamline care, promote patient-centered care, and is also an opportunity to reduce healthcare costs by an estimated $30 billion.<br><br><a target="_blank" href=https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/industry-voices-interoperability-can-reduce-healthcare-costs-by-30b-here-s-how>Read on fiercehealthcare.com</a>
