<p>Today, almost half of the world’s population does not have access to proper healthcare, with many people driven into poverty because of high health expenses. It is estimated that over $140 billion is required annually to meet the health-related sustainable development goal objectives. Further, significant health technology, digital technology, and artificial intelligence (AI) investments are needed to bridge the health service gap in emerging markets.</p>
