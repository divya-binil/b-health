<p><strong>What You Should Know:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>– Today Innovaccer Inc., the Health Cloud company, unveiled its <a href="https://innovaccer.com/solutions/prm/">Patient Relationship Management</a> (PRM) solution on the <a href="https://innovaccer.com/">InnovaccerⓇ Health Cloud</a>,&nbsp; the first solution to bring patients’ clinical and care episodes to the forefront of a tailored patient engagement journey.&nbsp;</p><p>– Now providers can integrate clinical data with claims, pharmacy, laboratory, SDoH, and other consumer information to establish a complete patient record that helps engagement strategies go beyond optimizing revenue to transform care delivery.</p><p><strong>Keep patients at the center of healthcare</strong></p><p>Current customer relationship management (CRM) solutions bring contact, engagement, purchase, and service interaction data into a customer profile, but they don’t include the patient’s clinical record. That’s where Innovaccer’s solution is different. Hosted on the Innovaccer Health Cloud and backed by its <a href="https://innovaccer.com/dap/">Data Activation Platform</a>, Innovaccer’s PRM solution streamlines patient engagement across all touchpoints, including care episodes. It brings together a state-of-the-art customer data platform, journey-based campaigns, care coordination workflows, digital front door, and contact center. The end result is one solution that allows providers to attract, engage, and retain patients, coordinate care, and give physicians insights at the point of care.</p>
