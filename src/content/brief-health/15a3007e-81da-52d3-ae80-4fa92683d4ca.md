<p>Broadly, the IoMT is a connected infrastructure of medical devices, software applications, and health systems and services.
With this, areas of the healthcare industry are being targeted for applications of the IoMT ranging from industry-wide data exchange to quality-of-life improvements for individual patients in their homes.
Expanding the connectivity of smart devices to healthcare networks allows efficient communications within hospitals, as well as communication with patients and other healthcare professionals externally.
Successful applications of the IoMT include remote monitoring of patients with chronic or long-term conditions.
Wearable devices can collect medical data from a patient and distribute the information to the relevant caregivers, as well as monitoring a patient’s activity.
Another interesting example of the IoMT is a device implantable into an artery which monitors pressure and relays information to external devices such that patients or healthcare professionals may be alerted to early signs of a stroke.
Imagine a seamless hospital experience including appointment booking, the ability to check waiting times, parking payments, check in, patient medical data being taken, data being transferred between departments instantaneously, medicine being prescribed, medicine intake being monitored, and continued remote monitoring of the patient, all using the IoMT and including aspects accessible by your smart device.
Despite this, the barriers to entry are by no means insurmountable and, with increasing development of the IoMT, the health industry will no doubt see the substantial benefits of implementing such technology.</p>
