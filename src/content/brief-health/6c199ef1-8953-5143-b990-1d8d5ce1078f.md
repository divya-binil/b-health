<p>The firm's global health leader speaks with Healthcare IT News about hybrid care, digital transformation, big data, generative AI and smart technology. According to a soon-to-be-released healthcare survey of more than 6,000 customers in the United States, Canada, England, Ireland, Australia, and Germany, in-person visits are still seen as having higher quality, outcomes, convenience, and usefulness than virtual visits. It has a lot more to say about the condition of healthcare and health IT today and was undertaken by the research and consultancy behemoth EY. In an interview with Aloha McBride, the company's global health leader, EY provided Healthcare IT News with a sneak glimpse of the survey findings. What have consumers recently said about healthcare and their expectations for telehealth? In the healthcare industry, it is crucial to focus on the patient. The EY team's analysis shows that healthcare is turning its emphasis to value-based treatment and contracting, but it appears that the perspectives of the consumer or patient are being ignored. Early in 2023, we conducted a global survey of more than 6,000 consumers in six different countries the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, England, and Germany to delve into this issue and learn more about what people value in healthcare. Understanding individual preferences and what matters most to consumers in terms of their health and treatment was our main focus.</p>
