<p>During this time, prolific investment into digital health solutions has jumpstarted unprecedented innovation, product development, and public acceptance, all necessities for leveraging the value of digital health.
At the Digital Medicine Society (DiMe), we have the privilege of partnering with the largest integrated health system in the US, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to implement digital innovation strategies that improve the lives of Veterans and the people who care for them.
We are proud to release The Playbook: Digital Healthcare Edition to help decision makers harness the power of digital to improve systems of care and the lives of patients.
Every innovator should reference this free guide daily in their decision making to navigate these challenges with proven tools and strategies to help them choose the right technologies to improve patient outcomes. The VHA has implemented digital health solutions to help advance innovation and transform its health system while supporting clinicians and improving patients’ lives.
EHR tools offer significant value and can improve care coordination, help identify and reduce medical errors, and maximize patient engagement - however, they don’t align with the cognitive and workflow requirements of clinicians or patients.
Health systems can employ digital health solutions that expand care delivery and address clinicians’ EHR needs when they focus on industry and vendor collaboration.
Virtual care uses live and async approaches to care for patients beyond the clinic.
It has become increasingly important for providers and health systems to use engagement tools that give patients public health information.</p>
