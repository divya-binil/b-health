<p>Over the past decade, healthcare organizations (HCOs) have relied on radio frequency identification (RFID) solutions to assist with patient identification and monitoring, as well as asset tracking. Pharmacy operations also see a benefit with the use of such technologies – RFID- based tracking methods have the potential to reduce medication errors, helping to promote patient safety.1 Yet, Matthew Farley, PharmD, Senior Manager, Medication Technology &amp; Analytics, Fresenius Kabi, said many HCOs are not fully leveraging the power of RFID technology when it comes to medication management. They are held back by arduous manual tagging and data association processes needed to identify medications.</p><p>“RFID technology has the ability to improve workflows so we can better ensure those critical medications are in the right place at the right time,” Farley explained. “Current RFID processes still require manual tagging. This is an extensive time commitment for pharmacy technicians and pharmacists because they need to make sure every RFID tag is appropriately associated with the medication – and that the lot number and expiration date are correctly entered into their systems. That can take up a lot of time.”</p>
