<p>Latest digital health project to enhance decision making across Australian hospitals
It will utilise Alcidion's Miya Precision platform to identify priority areas where decision support tools will add value.
The government-backed Digital Health Cooperative Research Centre has set up a A$1.5 million ($2.1 million) research project that will evaluate and improve clinical decision support tools across regional and metropolitan hospitals settings in Australia.
Their project will make use of Alcidion's Miya Precision system to identify priority areas where decision support tools will add value.
"With hospitals on the frontline of Australia’s healthcare delivery, this project aims to support clinical staff who are faced with an enormous number of decisions when treating patients – navigating the ever-growing array of drugs, tests, techniques, medical technology and health data now available," said DHCRC CEO Dr Terry Sweeney</p>
