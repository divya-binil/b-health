<p>We strongly believe that only digital health can bring healthcare into the 21st century and make patients the point-of-care.</p><p>Here on The Medical Futurist site we often show snippets of the future we imagine for healthcare. <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/our-vision">In this vision</a> that we often dub as a <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/how-would-have-covid-19-taken-place-in-a-digital-health-utopia">utopia</a>, we envision healthcare to be invisible, seamless and preventive. COVID-19 brought us much closer to what we had foreseen (from <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/get-used-to-it-remote-care-is-the-new-norm">telemed solutions</a> and <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/digital-health-tech-here-to-stay-after-covid-19">robots</a> to <a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/choosing-between-life-and-death-during-covid-19-the-a-i-trolley-problem">A.I.</a>), and these changes also made doctors feel the need to change. But, of course, itâ€™s not as easy as that.</p><p><a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/what-would-make-every-doctor-use-digital-health/">Read on medicalfuturist.com</a></p>
