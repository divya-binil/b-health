<p>Successful transformation towards value-based health care (VBHC) involves a change to the organizational culture. This must be done inclusively, with a reward system and outcome-based incentive model that is focused on achieving a common goal: deliver the best health outcomes to patients.</p><p>In Part 2 of this interview, Christina Åkerman speaks to us about how to implement such an outcome-based incentive model to ensure the success of VBHC in your organization.</p><p>Click here to see Part 1 of this interview: <a href="https://healthcaretransformers.com/healthcare-business/vbhc-patient-outcomes/">Transforming towards VBHC and improving patient outcomes</a></p><p><strong>Implementing an outcome-based incentive model</strong></p><p><strong>HT:</strong> <i>You talk about rewards systems and outcome-based incentive models being key to the successful implementation of VBHC, how do you recommend that these models be created and who should be involved in their design?</i></p><p><strong>Christina Åkerman:</strong> To me, the only way to design financial rewards systems for the long term is to base them on measuring and reporting health outcomes. This is a stepwise approach.</p><p>The first step is to move towards bundled payments as it is essential to integrate budgets across the entire care pathway. This way, you don’t have budgets for certain procedures or specialties.</p>
