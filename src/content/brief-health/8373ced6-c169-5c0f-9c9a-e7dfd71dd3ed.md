<p>The layoffs represent 13% of the AI-backed genomic and clinical data company's workforce.
Sema4 announced Tuesday the AI-backed genomic and clinical data company was laying off around 250 workers, about 13% of its workforce, as part of a larger restructuring. Combined with earlier layoffs from the first half of the year, Sema4 said it has cut approximately 30% of the jobs from its legacy business.
Sema4 said the restructuring puts the company on track to save $50 million in 2022.</p>
