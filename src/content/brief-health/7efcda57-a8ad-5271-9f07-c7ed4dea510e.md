<p>Behavioral Health Service Practice Challenges Behavioral health practice faces multiple challenges form its initial start-up to scaling-up its operation for service delivery.&nbsp;<br><br>It starts with a lack of BHS recording system, much like what an Electronic Health Record (EHR) providing support for the medical practice.
But without the client BHS recording capabilities, BHS practices are left with few options: either go paper-based oriented approach or pay a significant fund for customization from EHR systems.
The second approach is to pay EHR professional service team for customization of BHS recording capability.
With EHR systems not supporting the basic BHS recording capabilities, supporting CARF compliant requirements are out of question for BHS practices; hence, it eliminates the opportunity to scale up the operation, both in term of potential higher reimbursements and higher quality of service delivery.
If we assume that there is an EHR solution addressing all the above challenge, the inability to reconciliate between the service delivery system and the financial software solution such as QuickBooks is critical for the BHS practice.</p>
