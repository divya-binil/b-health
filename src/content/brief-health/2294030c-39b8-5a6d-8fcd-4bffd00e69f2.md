The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership this week announced a transformative partnership to establish the University of Maryland 3 Institute for Health Computing, or UM-3-IHC. The new institute will focus on AI and machine learning, virtual and augmented reality, 5G technologies, precision medicine, telehealth and more.

&quot;Our vision is for this to become the East Coast Silicon Valley for health computing. The goals of this new Institute perfectly align with the University of Maryland School of Medicine&#39;s new strategic vision to utilize disruptive technology and embrace and harness the power of clinical analytics and precision medicine to enhance patient care and provide population health services,&quot; said Dr. Mark T. Gladwin, vice president for medical affairs at University of Maryland, Baltimore.
