<p>It’s no secret that research studies and clinical trial sites struggle with recruitment.
In recent years, the pharma industry has supported a more ‘patient-centered’ approach to clinical trial delivery.
It’s no secret that during study feasibility, site staff often overestimate the volume of qualified patients they have in their database.
And if they do have patients that meet study criteria, in many cases, the patient is not motivated to participate in a trial.
In order to improve study recruitment and retention, adjustments need to be made at multiple touchpoints along the patient recruitment journey, not just the study sites.
Making sure that a qualified patient successfully enrolls in a study is a team effort.
If a cancer patient applies to a study with the aid of a clinical support team, the chances of that patient converting into a study participant increase exponentially.</p>
