<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/developer-popular-womens-fertility-tracking-app-settles-ftc">Federal Trade Commission</a> announcement this week of a proposed health data privacy settlement with Flo Health, a fertility-tracking mobile app vendor, illustrates how the agency can play a critical role in helping ensure data not regulated under HIPAA is protected.</p><p>The Wilmington, Delaware-based app vendor has agreed to a major revamp of its <a href="http://www.healthcareinfosecurity.com/privacy-c-151">privacy</a> practices under a proposed settlement with the FTC. The commission alleged the startup company violated the FTC Act by misrepresenting to millions of women how it shared their sensitive health data with third-party analytics firms.</p><p>Under the proposed settlement, which will be finalized after a public comment period, Flo Health must get app users' consent before sharing their health information. It also must obtain an independent review of its privacy practices.</p>
