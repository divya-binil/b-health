<p>As healthcare spending continues to rise, so too does the inherent risk for bad actors to take advantage. Today, the United States is estimated to spend <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NHE-Fact-Sheet">nearly 18 percent</a> of its GDP, or $3.6 trillion, on healthcare, and is expected to increase to one-fifth of GDP within the next decade, according to the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2019)3&amp;docLanguage=En">latest data</a>. This alone provides ample motivation for fraud and abuse. While the full extent of healthcare fraud is difficult to measure,</p><p>The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association (NHCAA) conservatively estimates that <a href="https://www.nhcaa.org/resources/health-care-anti-fraud-resources/the-challenge-of-health-care-fraud.aspx">3 percent</a> – $68 billion – of all healthcare spending is lost to fraud each year. Others, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), estimate fraud accounts for up to <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/white-collar-crime/health-care-fraud">10 percent</a> of healthcare expenditures.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/tag/coronavirus-covid-19/">COVID-19 pandemic</a> has only accelerated the motivation for fraud and abuse amid the increased fear, confusion, and a relaxed regulatory environment. From fake cures to malware and illegitimate charities, fraudsters are taking advantage. <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/category/technology/telehealth-2/">Telehealth</a>, which has experienced <a href="https://www.merritthawkins.com/news-and-insights/media-room/press/-Physician-Practice-Patterns-Changing-as-a-Result-of-COVID-19/">exponential growth</a> aided by regulatory accommodations to facilitate its widespread adoption, is an area of particular concern. In turn, states and healthcare organizations must optimize their program integrity operations and telehealth strategy to stay protected amid healthcare’s new normal.&nbsp;</p>
