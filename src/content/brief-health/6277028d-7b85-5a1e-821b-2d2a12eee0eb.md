<p>Abridge’s technology ‘will not only close the documentation cycle in real-time, but also improve the overall quality and consistency of our clinical notes,’ says Gregory Ator, M.D., CMIO at the University of Kansas Health System. The University of Kansas Health System is implementing an artificial intelligence-powered medical documentation solution from the business Abridge to fight provider burnout brought on by rising documentation obligations. Abridge, a company based in Pittsburgh, claims that its technology extracts more than 90% of the important information from provider-patient talks and produces summaries in the forms favoured by physicians. The provider is kept informed, increasing productivity, according to the company, but their judgement is never taken away. The main technology functions as an intelligent copilot, producing well-organized draughts and offering interactive tools to speed up the editing process, guaranteeing that providers get started right away when a visit is over. To simplify and streamline documentation, the system readily interfaces with healthcare applications, such as Epic, the company claimed.</p>
