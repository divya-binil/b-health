<p>Care.ai is an AI-powered ambient monitoring platform for healthcare facilities: the company's Smart Care Facility Platform transforms healthcare settings into responsive care facilities that continuously monitor patient activity and the surrounding clinical and operational workflows.&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on their care setting and needs, healthcare organizations can use the platform to improve operations such as infection prevention and control, patient and protocol monitoring, workforce optimization, virtual care, and virtual nursing.</p><p>It's that last solution that interested Ardent Health Services, which is why earlier this week the two companies announced a partnership to implement care.ai’s Virtual Nursing solution at Lovelace Medical Center, Ardent’s Albuquerque, New Mexico-based affiliate.</p>
