<p>There is a strong push for health care to move towards greater value-based care (VBC) arrangements. The prospect of VBC holds the opportunity to re-create partnerships designed to increase health care sustainability by strategically improving processes, care delivery, and patient outcomes to achieve higher quality output at a decreased cost. Furthermore, the held potential will not be optimized until providers, payers, patients, and communities are connected in this common goal and as equal stakeholders in health system redesign.</p><p>Providers, payers, and patients all stand to benefit from greater development and alignment of VBC arrangements. Patients want more connected and transparent care that is convenient to their needs and avoids unnecessary delays in services. Providers want to receive on-time accurate payments and reduce administrative burdens so they can spend more time connecting with the patient and focusing on health outcomes. Payers desire higher value (primarily assessed through performance on standardized quality metrics) with minimalized utilization waste while building patient and provider loyalty and trust.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
