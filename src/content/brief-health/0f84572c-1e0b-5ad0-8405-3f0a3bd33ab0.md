<p>Experts Atul Butte and Jim Stolze answer our audience's insightful questions from our data monetization event.<br><br>In February we had the pleasure of hosting both Atul Butte and Jim Stolze in our latest virtual event – Data monetization in healthcare: How to safely share your data for the sake of science.
The role of the patient in the future of data monetization
Q2: In the spirit of the low code/no code trend, is it possible to simplify AI tools so that even patients and consumers could potentially analyze their data and manage their care in the future?
Atul Butte: Yes, indeed I think AI-driven tools to help patients understand their own data is the future.
That’s going to change, as AI trained with health data is used to best inform a patient what could be next for them, and what might be missing in their health care.
But I don’t think it’s the patient’s responsibility to store and guard the data.
Atul Butte: Certainly patients should have as much data on themselves as possible (and when appropriate, their family members).
But we as health systems cannot depend on patients having their data when we need it.
We also need to keep the data we have on our patients as well.
Q4: How do you ensure the accuracy of AI algorithms given that there may be bias in the data sets?
Atul Butte: We believe that AI trained on larger and larger data sets, with data from more diverse individuals, is the best way to ensure the most generalizable and robust algorithm possible.
Q5: Is there a risk that Real-World Data (RWD) could be a source of bias considering that the data generated is from patients who have access to relatively better medical care to start with?
So having access to data to train computers in a safe, responsible way, is likely going to be quite valuable for health systems, companies, and patients.</p>
