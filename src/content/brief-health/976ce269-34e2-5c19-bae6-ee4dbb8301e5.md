<p>“We are incredibly grateful to our investors for their support as we work to build evidence-based prescription digital therapeutics to address the mental health crisis head-on, improving access to treatment for adolescents and ensuring care is delivered when it is needed most,” CEO Ben Lewis said in a statement.
The larger staff will allow Limbix to speed development and testing of new digital therapeutics for other mental health disorders common among teens.
Other players in pediatric and adolescent behavioral health include BeMe Health, which recently raised $7 million in seed funding; Brightline, which is planning a program for children with autism spectrum disorder; and DotCom Therapy and Goodside Health, which recently partnered to increase access to mental healthcare in schools.</p>
