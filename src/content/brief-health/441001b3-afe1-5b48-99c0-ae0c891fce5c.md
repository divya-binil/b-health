      Founder and CEO Kristen Valdes has spent her entire career focused on
      providing quality healthcare to underserved populations in our country. 
      When Kristen experienced the healthcare system as a consumer, she quickly
      realized that she hadn't accomplished nearly enough.


      Her middle child Bailey suffers from a significant autoimmune disorder. 
      Even as a healthcare "expert," it took Kristen seven years to advocate for
      her daughter to get an appropriate diagnosis. Together, they experienced
      countless misdiagnoses, costly repeat procedures, and diagnoses based on
      limited and siloed health data.
