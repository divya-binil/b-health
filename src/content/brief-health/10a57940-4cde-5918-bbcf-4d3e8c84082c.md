<p>Calls for healthcare to do more to embrace technology as a means to improve care delivery must first address whether such changes add to or ease the burden of a workforce that's been beleaguered by the pandemic.</p><p>Advancements made in the use of digital tools like telehealth, remote patient monitoring and predictive analytics have been touted throughout the pandemic for helping healthcare organizations address the access challenges caused by months of limited in-person patient contact at many facilities.</p><p>But it's critical that stakeholders ensure these innovations make life for easier, not harder, for clinical and administrative workers.

We've got to solve that," said Dr. Rod Hochman, CEO of Providence and current chair of the American Hospital Association, during the summit's opening keynote address.</p>
