<p>Dysphagia is a condition that causes difficulty in swallowing and affects over 15 million people in the US.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine trying to enjoy a meal, but every bite feels like a challenge. Well, that is a daily reality for those suffering from this condition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It not only affects their ability to eat and drink but also takes an emotional toll, leading to frustration and isolation. Moreover, it increases the chances of choking or aspiration (where food or liquid enters the lungs instead of the stomach.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thankfully, medical technology is continuously evolving to address the needs of people with dysphagia- making mealtimes safer and more enjoyable. Here are a few emerging technologies that offer hope to patients and improve their quality of life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) Devices</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the issues that people with dysphagia often face is difficulty speaking or expressing their needs and desires. This can be extremely frustrating and isolating, as communication plays a vital role in everyday scenarios.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The good news is that Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices are innovative tools that solve this challenge. These devices assist patients in communicating effectively using different methods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For instance, they can use speech-generating devices, which allow them to type or select pre-programmed messages that are then spoken aloud. Symbol boards and picture-based systems are also available, where they can point to symbols or pictures to convey their thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eye-tracking systems are another option, where the device detects eye movements to select messages or options on a screen. Perhaps it won’t be wrong to say that these AAC devices give a voice to the voiceless, allowing them to express themselves, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2021/03/12/how-to-keep-a-conversation-going-10-ways-to-connect-and-engage-with-anyone-anywhere/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engage in conversations</a>, and maintain social connections. Furthermore, it reduces the feelings of isolation and frustration.</p>
<p><strong>NG/OG Tube</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stating the obvious, due to difficulty swallowing, patients lack proper nutrition and hydration. This can lead to malnutrition and dehydration, impacting their overall health and well-being. In such cases, healthcare professionals may use NG/OG tubes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also known as Nasogastric and Orogastric tubes, these are <a href="https://rightbiometrics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fluid technologies</a> inserted through the nose or mouth into the stomach. These are typically thin and flexible and allow liquid nutrition or fluids to be directly delivered into the stomach, ensuring patients receive the necessary nourishment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is also worth noting that NG/OG tubes can be temporary or used for a more extended period, depending on the individual’s needs. So, one must learn about these in detail from the healthcare professionals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Texture Modification</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, when consuming solid food, patients are prone to the risk of choking. Fortunately, texture modification techniques help address this issue by altering the consistency of food and liquids to make swallowing safer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thickening agents, such as commercial or <a href="https://www.brit.co/food/food-adulting/best-food-thickeners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural food-based thickeners</a>, adjust the viscosity of liquids, making them easier to swallow without compromising nutritional value.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By ensuring that foods and liquids are in a form that can be safely swallowed, these techniques provide patients with the opportunity to enjoy a wide range of food options while minimizing the risk of complications.</p>
<h2><strong>Key Takeaway </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are the major innovative technologies revolutionizing dysphagia care, enhancing the quality of life for individuals affected by this condition. With continued advancements in medical technology, we can expect further improvements, making mealtimes easier, communication more accessible, and overall well-being enhanced for individuals living with dysphagia.</p>
