<p>The proposal provides a "valuable tool to support the electronic submission of healthcare information," said CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. It would reduce provider burden and could save more than $450 million a year. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services unveiled a new proposed rule on Monday that will amend HIPAA to better enable prior authorization and claims-related transactions by establishing guidelines for the use of electronic signatures in healthcare attachments transactions. Adoption of Standards for Health Care Attachments Transactions and Electronic Signatures, and Modification to Referral Certification and Authorization Transaction Standard are the titles of the proposed regulations (CMS-0053-P). If adopted, it would encourage the establishment of standards for transactions with pre authorization attachments, such as medical records, X-rays, and provider notes describing physician referrals. A standard for the referral certification and authorisation transaction would be included in the HIPAA amendments. According to the proposed rule, administrative costs might be reduced by $454 million annually.</p>
